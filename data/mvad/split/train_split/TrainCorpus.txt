He unsheathes the silver dagger.
At night, we swoop low over the streets of Springfield passing smoking chimneys as lightning flashes in the distance. At the end of the street, SOMEONE approaches a pharmacy in his long coat and stovepipe hat.
Clutching the letter, he peers in through a window.
The young man steps inside and lets the door swing shut behind him.
He crosses the floor between two service counters quickening his pace as he nears the back.
In the pharmacy workroom, a bespectacled man with sizable sideburns grinds a pestle in a mortar.
As he turns, SOMEONE narrows his eyes. Stibble rests the pestle against the mortar's rim. As SOMEONE reaches in his coat, Stibble bears his fangs. SOMEONE charges, but the vampire throws powder.
The dust clears revealing Stibble's distorted, monstrous features. He knocks SOMEONE back then activates a trapdoor. The vampire hunter plunges through and a rope snare catches him around the ankle.
Nearby, a naked man hanging upside down shows no sign of life. We pull back to find SOMEONE in a room full of victims, each suspended upside down. The young hunter futile reaches for the floor.
Beside him, blood streams from a dying man into bowls set on the floor.
His ax lies beside them.
Arriving, Stibble kicks it away and strikes him.
He binds SOMEONE's wrists.
As the trapped hunter looks on, the vampire opens a gleaming straight razor, turns it over and touches the blade. SOMEONE resumes his struggle to free himself as Stibble sharpens the blade against the porcelain bowl's ornate rim. Crouching low, the vampire slips the bowl beneath the hunter.
SOMEONE's dagger slips from his belt. He catches it in his feet then slashes the vampire's throat.
Contracting his abdomen, he curls upward and cuts through the snare rope. SOMEONE falls to the floor, frees his wrists and retrieves his ax. As Stibble charges, he delivers a mighty upward blow.
Spraying blood soaks half his face. Using his hand, SOMEONE wipes it away with a horrified expression.

He notices a door sliding open and throws another handful.
It hits an invisible mass. The banker reappears just long enough to strike SOMEONE's midsection.
The hunter reaches in his pocket, but finds no more grain.
In the dusty air, he spies a shape approaching and throws his ax. Dodging it, the charging vampire reappears. SOMEONE sidesteps and decapitates him on a vault shelf.
Later, the banker’s head lies upside down in a grave.
SOMEONE buries him amid several other graves. In a smithy, a powerfully build vampire blocks SOMEONE's attack and bends him back over the forge. The hunter stomps on a bellows and the blazing flame sends the vampire reeling back. SOMEONE grabs him and thrusts his head into the fire repeatedly stomping on the bellows. Now on a picnic with SOMEONE, SOMEONE dozes off spilling a cup of tea.
She nods. SOMEONE takes her cup and sets it down then takes her hands in his.
He leans forward, staring up at her earnestly.
SOMEONE turns her head away and presses her lips together suppressing a smile.

Gazing after her, SOMEONE trips.
From across the street, a one-eyed SOMEONE leers at the tender scene.
Stepping forward, he sees SOMEONE pause at the door to watch her suitor go.
Now in the deep South, a veiled woman rides a horse up a dirt path to a plantation house. Trees dripping with Spanish moss provide a canopy overhead.
Later, she strides into a dining room where SOMEONE sits alone at a table.
She slaps a newspaper down before him and sits.
SOMEONE ignores it. She slides the paper closer and he turns.
Boasting strawberry blonde tresses and sultry features, SOMEONE puffs a pipe.
Frowning, SOMEONE takes up the paper and reads a headline.
Six headless bodies found near Springfield. SOMEONE Stibble Jr among the dead.
Smirking, SOMEONE lifts his brow.
Now in the general store, SOMEONE reads a book. An African-American man steps inside, takes off his hat and shuts the door.
SOMEONE eyes the visitor from his desk
Noticing a scar on the visitor's cheek, SOMEONE remembers.
He hops over the counter and hugs him.
He takes off his apron.
SOMEONE ducks a swipe from the first man then SOMEONE strikes again. Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in a jail cell. SOMEONE paces outside the bars.
She reaches through the bars and turns SOMEONE's head.

Gin Creek. Our view roves toward the shipping warehouse across the dock.
SOMEONE sidles around the exterior of the building, his silver tipped ax in hand.
He stops at a corner.
Returning from a corral, SOMEONE throws down a pitchfork.
He stops and sniffs the air.
Grimacing, he takes of his sunglasses.
SOMEONE attacks.
SOMEONE backs away.
He flees among his frightened horses. An aerial view shows the herd crossing a riverside field. As the vampire runs up ahead, SOMEONE mounts one of the horses.
SOMEONE leaps forward between two horses, grabs onto their necks and hangs between them.
He slams the horses into the ground and they tumble across the dirt obstructing SOMEONE's path. As SOMEONE jumps one of the horses, he falls off his own. He rolls to a stop and stands up to find himself facing the oncoming stampede. A horse brushes past him and he staggers. A second and third knock him around. He spots SOMEONE leaping over the herd.
The vampire tackles him and bares his fangs.
SOMEONE blocks him with the shaft of his ax. They both see a horse charging straight for them.
The stallion knocks SOMEONE off SOMEONE sending him tumbling across the dirt. The vampire rises to his feet. He boldly grabs the front leg of an oncoming horse, flipping the steed on its back. Using the horse like a track and field hammer, he hurls it at his enemy knocking him to the ground. Amid the chaos of the stampede, the horse rises with SOMEONE on its back.
The vampire hunter rides on leaning down for his ax as he passes. Up ahead, SOMEONE bounds off the back of two horses and mounts a third. SOMEONE nears his target holding his ax at the ready. SOMEONE glances back over his shoulder.
He ducks the swing of the ax. SOMEONE leans back as SOMEONE throws a roundhouse kick. The vampire grabs the ax and flips SOMEONE on to the back of another horse. As SOMEONE mounts the horse, he sees SOMEONE run off across the backs of the herd. SOMEONE attempts to stand on his horse's back.
He rises to his feet then runs after the vampire landing on a new horse's back with every daring step. Through a veil of wafting dust, we glimpse SOMEONE as he looks back and grins.
SOMEONE lunges at him swiping at his legs, but the vampire jumps, flips and lands on a horse behind SOMEONE. He tries to bite SOMEONE's exposed neck, but the vampire hunter blocks the bite with his ax and pushes them off the horse. SOMEONE clings to SOMEONE's boot as the herd runs alongside a bluff. He lets go.
SOMEONE falls off the horse and tumbles down the face of the bluff. Rolling to a stop, he loses his ax. SOMEONE pounces on him and bares his hideous fangs. SOMEONE's spots his weapon and reaches for it, but SOMEONE stomps the handle flipping the ax into the air.
The vampire grabs the ax and nearly splits SOMEONE's face. SOMEONE grabs the shaft, extends it to reveal a hidden trigger, then shoots SOMEONE through his good eye. SOMEONE lands on his back. Standing over him, SOMEONE collapses his modified weapon and readies himself for a final strike.
SOMEONE brings down his ax. Now at night, a man forces a young woman through a narrow alley.
He slams her against a brick wall clutching her throat.
Behind the man, SOMEONE steps out from a shadowy recess across the alley.
With a calm, deliberate gaze, he nears the rapist's exposed neck and takes a bite.
As the vampire brings his flailing victim down, the young woman escapes down the alley.

As he kisses a woman leaning out of the window, he notices a team of riders approaching.
The dark haired woman sits back and SOMEONE hands her a gun.
He draws a dagger.
As SOMEONE approaches the group, a rider hops down from his horse and disappears. As the others look on, the unshaven man holds his ground awaiting the imminent attack.
The vampire appears and SOMEONE dodges a swipe. He ducks another, then slashes his attacker's masked mouth creating a spectacular spray of gore.
A mildly frustrated SOMEONE dismounts. SOMEONE tries to stab his attacker, but the vampire clutches his wrist. He drops his dagger, catches it with his free hand, then slashes and leg sweeps his foe. He slashes a second attacker's kicking leg, then drives his blade through the vampire's palm and flips him onto his back.
SOMEONE nears. SOMEONE attacks, but the seasoned vampire deflects his every strike. He kicks the human in the face. In slow motion, SOMEONE twirls through the air and lands at SOMEONE's feet. The vampire takes off his sunglasses revealing his puffy eyes. SOMEONE kicks out SOMEONE's shin and the vampire almost falls on his dagger. From behind, SOMEONE's love attacks SOMEONE, but two minions seize her. SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE from behind, exposes his neck and sinks his teeth in.
SOMEONE looks up from his trembling victim, his mouth dripping with blood.
He grabs a tuft of SOMEONE's hair and lowers him to his knee.
As SOMEONE crosses to the dark haired woman, a dazed SOMEONE rises to his feet but struggles to maintain his balance. He watches SOMEONE wrap his arms around her.
Sinking his teeth into her neck, he spins her around lifting her off her feet.
SOMEONE's eyes roll back.
He watches the attack in a stupor, his jaw hanging slack.
SOMEONE slows his spin to a stop then let's his victim sink to the ground.
Trembling, face down, SOMEONE watches his dead love.
With his boot, SOMEONE rolls her on her back.

SOMEONE lowers his demoralized gaze.
SOMEONE leaves him standing alone.
SOMEONE glances back at the riders then goes to his love's side.
He gently turns her face to his own and kisses her on the lips.
Back in the present.
Beside SOMEONE, SOMEONE rises to his feet.
The seated vampire meets his gaze.
As SOMEONE walks away, a flash of lightning brightens the alley's walls.
Now through a downpour, the tall, young man crosses a street.
Wearing his top hat and overcoat.
He steps onto a curb and crosses a sidewalk heading for the general store.
As he unlocks the front door, someone approaches him from behind.
As SOMEONE looks up from the door, a hooded figure nears.
Pulling his ax from his jacket, he turns to strike.
SOMEONE reaches into his jacket.
SOMEONE watches as he takes a knee and holds up a ring.
Gazing at the ring, she takes a deep breath.
As SOMEONE offers her hand, SOMEONE rises to his feet and puts the ring on her finger.
They share a loving smile then SOMEONE cradles SOMEONE's cheeks.
She rests her hands on his shoulders and they kiss.
The tall, young man lifts his fiancée into his arms.

One of the two men steps down beside SOMEONE then clubs him.
Now SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in his study.
SOMEONE takes a seat and hands SOMEONE the book.
He finds a flowery invitation inside. SOMEONE quickly gathers his jacket and hat.
Now on a boat.
They stand on the deck of their humble vessel as it approaches a fleet of steam-powered riverboats crowding a bustling harbor. Pillars of black smoke plume skyward for miles.
New Orleans.
Now, Spanish moss hangs low from the branches of surrounding trees as SOMEONE and SOMEONE ride a modest horse drawn carriage up a narrow path.
On either side, wooden shacks show no sign of inhabitance.
A pot hangs over a stack of firewood.
From inside a shack, a mocha-skinned woman with a head-kerchief wields a rifle as she peers out through a gap in the wood slat wall.
At night, the carriage approaches the plantation house.
The moonlit Spanish moss over their head sways eerily in a breeze.
Now, a window reflects burning candles and frames SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they walk up to the house.
Peering in, they find white people waltzing with slaves at a ball.
Among them, SOMEONE recoils from SOMEONE as she holds him tight.
SOMEONE draws his ax.
He hurries away. Inside.
SOMEONE lunges at SOMEONE baring her fangs.
As SOMEONE stares, the vampires attack the slaves. SOMEONE wrenches free, but the shy woman succumbs to a vicious bite. SOMEONE watches pleasurably.
As SOMEONE fight off the attacker, slaves all around him fall victim to the vamps. Two grab SOMEONE. SOMEONE kicks open the door and races in as a few survivors flee.
Seated in a chair, SOMEONE smirks while two of his underlings hold SOMEONE on his knees. One story up, two vampires in a mural turn. They leap from a ledge in front of the painting and claw the wood floor.
Charging, they disappear. SOMEONE throws his hat at one then strikes him down. He takes down the other in a single strike.
Swinging at a third, SOMEONE drops his ax. He delivers a powerful roundhouse kick as more and more vampires join the fray, a staring SOMEONE backs away from the window. One vampire seizes SOMEONE's ax. The hunter kicks him away and twirls it into an upward swing taking out one vamp after another. Looking on, SOMEONE discreetly works through ropes binding his wrists. An invisible vampire grabs a sword then materializes to attack. SOMEONE disarms him, but three more surround him.
As he swings at one, it vanishes. Another swipes his claws. SOMEONE ducks them then embeds his ax in the creature's abdomen.
In slow motion, he wrenches the weapon out sending a splash of blood through the air.
As he finishes the vampire off, SOMEONE frees himself and fights off his captor. SOMEONE kicks him into a pillar splintering its wood. Propelling himself off another pillar, SOMEONE takes out two vamps in a single swing. SOMEONE stalks towards him as he fights a third. SOMEONE beheads his foe and finds SOMEONE in pants, swirling her long skirt like a cape. Slicing through it he finds her gone.
From behind, she kicks him to the floor as SOMEONE throws her a chair. She backflips through the air catches it and lands in the seat on top of SOMEONE. Straddling the chair, she peers down at his face.
She pins his arms beneath her boot.
The high mural becomes an animated depiction of slavery throughout world history.
He crouches beside SOMEONE.
Standing, SOMEONE steps away.
A vamp holds SOMEONE.
SOMEONE struggles.
SOMEONE puts a dagger to SOMEONE's throat.
The horse drawn carriage crashes through a window.
SOMEONE fights free as SOMEONE drives in. The carriage skids in blood knocking SOMEONE off of SOMEONE. He grabs his ax.
He and SOMEONE catch up to the carriage and climb on to the back. It loses a wheel as it speeds out, but continues down the dirt path. Later, they run.
They halt in their tracks.
A team of horsemen approach.
The mocha-skinned woman rows a raft.
The three man dash from the riverbank and find the raft waiting for them. Trees hide them as the horsemen ride past with a colony of bats swooping overhead. On the raft, the men and their rescuer duck low.
As the danger passes, SOMEONE stands and takes up the long poled oar.
At dawn, we gaze out over the winding bayou.
Later, the raft arrives at a shore facing a stately brick church.
SOMEONE gets off first and helps the others.
He and SOMEONE pull the raft up on shore then follow the woman with SOMEONE.
A pastor comes out to meet them.
Now as SOMEONE climbs into an attic.
SOMEONE offers a hand to help him up.
Runaway slaves fill the cramped, dusty space.
Many slumber, lie down on unused pews while some curl up on the floor.
A baby lies in a makeshift cradle.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE go to a shuttered window and peer through while Tubman takes up her rifle.
SOMEONE bumps a bell.
Outside, SOMEONE looks up.
As SOMEONE looks on anxiously, SOMEONE waves the search team on.
He relaxes and faces Speed who sighs.
SOMEONE bounces the baby, soothing it.

The men turn. SOMEONE comes in and greets the men with a crisp smile.
SOMEONE shoots a cutting look at SOMEONE who lowers his gaze.
SOMEONE twirls his ax.
SOMEONE lays the ax in a chest.
Now, our view spirals from sideways to upright as a door opens and a tall, silhouetted figure strides through.
Clad in a trim long coat and the famous stovepipe hat, SOMEONE marches resolutely towards us. As he draws near, we find him aged and distinguished.
Sporting his trademark presidential beard. Now before the Capitol with its dome under construction.
As a canon fires, words appear: Fort Sumter, 1861. Within the fort, Union and Confederate troops clash in a chaotic battle as smoke fills the air. A bearded Union General leads a charge. Now, the wall of a toy fort topples as a young boy plays in the Oval Office.
As SOMEONE reads a letter, SOMEONE arrives.
The men turn and the boy looks up from his play.
SOMEONE lowers his troubled gaze and SOMEONE steps away.
A gracefully aging SOMEONE approaches the desk with a meal on a tray.
She plants her hands on her hips and her gaze falls on a headline.
20,000 soldiers dead.
SOMEONE shifts his sorrowful gaze and SOMEONE heads out.
The young boy follows his mother.
The child pauses.
Turning around, he returns to his father's desk and kisses his sunken cheek.
The boy goes to his namesake who kisses his cheek.
Beaming shyly, the little boy leaves with a jaunty stride.
SOMEONE gazes after him lovingly as SOMEONE tosses down a paper.
The Emancipation Proclamation lies before him.
He signs it. Now before Congress.
Outside the Capitol.
Now in the White House, a maid uses a feather duster on a clock. It's SOMEONE.
Later, she smiles and nods demurely as she passes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE pauses briefly looking over her shoulder at the sultry woman.
SOMEONE slips into a bedroom where SOMEONE wears a Union uniform as he plays with toy soldiers.
She shuts the door.
Coming close, SOMEONE lays down on her stomach.
Props herself on her elbows and chats sweetly with the child.
As he answers her, she glances over her shoulder.
SOMEONE blows a toy horn and they share a mirthful smile.
His hand close to hers, he presents a gleaming toy sword made of silver.
She takes his hand and kisses his wrist. The toy sword drops to the carpet.
Now SOMEONE comes in as SOMEONE lies sick in bed.
Sitting with SOMEONE on the bed, he notices dark, swollen veins branching from a bite on the boy's wrist. SOMEONE's eyes widen and he stands. Watching him, SOMEONE notices his stricken gaze as he looks away.
Stepping away, SOMEONE crosses to a sunlit window.
SOMEONE turns and faces him questioningly.
Staring off, SOMEONE remembers his dying mother writhing as her eyes rolled back in her head.
Now the President wakes in a chair at SOMEONE's bedside.
Stretching, he finds SOMEONE sleeping on the bed cradling their son in her arms.
Moving gingerly, SOMEONE gets to his feet.
His gaze lands on a spot on the carpet.
He drapes his jacket over SOMEONE like a blanket.
Then crouches at his toys. The silver pocket watch gleams among them.
SOMEONE picks it up and opens it revealing SOMEONE's personalized inscription.
He lifts his stunned gaze.
Now, SOMEONE steps out onto a balcony on a beautiful day and pauses.
Turning, he finds SOMEONE sitting on the concrete.
His long legs stretched out before him.
He slumps dejectedly against a pillar.
SOMEONE crosses to his lifelong friend and drapes his jacket around his shoulders.
Stepping in front of SOMEONE, he crouches and touches his arm.
SOMEONE offers a sympathetic gaze, then straightens and stands over him.
The President looks up at him.
SOMEONE draws a deep knowing breath and gazes off.
Nighttime. A carriage rides past the mist-enshrouded White House.
In the presidential home, SOMEONE kneels at SOMEONE's bed in prayer.
Before him, the lifeless child wears a dark suit.
His hands clasped demurely.
SOMEONE comes in and sinks to his knees at the other side of the bed.
The President lifts his head staring off as he rubs his thumbs together.
Looking past SOMEONE, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE arriving in the doorway dressed in mourning.
SOMEONE stands. SOMEONE nods wearily.
She beats his chest.
Overwhelmed with sobs, SOMEONE rushes from the room.
SOMEONE starts to go then pauses in the doorway.
SOMEONE's eyes widen and he lowers his remorseful gaze.
Now a photographer stands in the middle of a field littered with the bodies of Union soldiers.
In the Oval Office.
Leaving the room, he hands over a telegram order.
On SOMEONE's plantation, we zoom up the path leading to his door.
It opens as he walks out a man with a bearded chin.
A servant brings red beverages.
SOMEONE takes up the goblets.
SOMEONE returns a goblet.
Sipping his drink, SOMEONE spits it out. Splotches of red stain a war map in his hand.
Our view zooms in on a red stain north of Gettysburg which becomes a smoking field beneath an overcast sky. Swooping low, we find Confederate soldiers charging recklessly over the grass as cannon balls touch down all around them.
Union soldiers fire the canons from a high ridge.
As a cannonball touches down with a stories high blast, Confederate soldier march straight towards it. A row of cannon barrels amid smoke and sparks as they fire. In the infantry below, a thin Union soldier clutches a photo of a woman as he stands by the bearded General.
The thin soldier aims a rifle with his brothers-in-arms.
A cannon ball blasts behind the Confederates.
One or two fall, but the rest charge on seemingly unharmed by the bullets. They drop their rifles. The thin soldier faces his General.
A pale Confederate runs on despite a blood spraying chest wound and a bullet through his hand. Another bears his fangs. As the General shoots, the Confederates vanish. A force knocks his head off and his men fall behind him.
A Confederate flag topples to the ground.
The General turns and finds the thin soldier spitting up blood beside him.
He holds up a shaking hand and a shaft of light shining through a hole in his chest hits his palm.
He sinks to his knees then keels over.
Turning, the General finds every man in his unit sprawled on the ground.
The thin soldier's photograph of his sweetheart flutters down to the grass. The General stares at the departing Confederates.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE dine at opposite ends of a long table.
SOMEONE's sips her drink and takes up her soupspoon.
SOMEONE turns the silver utensil in his hand.
SOMEONE watches him with wide eyes. The President springs up from his seat.
He shows the utensil.
Now, Union soldiers move in and out of wealthy residences bringing out bulging sacks and armloads of silver items. As we peer down through the clouds, we find carts loaded with silver twinkling in the sunlight as they travel through the streets. SOMEONE enters his house and peers out a window through his sunglasses. Now, Speed rides in a carriage with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE eyes the vampire uneasily.
In a factory, SOMEONE watches workers melt the silver.
SOMEONE joins him at a high railing overlooking the work floor.
The molten silver churns in enormous vats. SOMEONE faces his old friend who looks down with a thoughtful gaze.
Now fog drifts over the White House lawn at dusk.
In SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE lies in the small bed in a demure white nightgown.
She keeps her melancholy gaze averted as SOMEONE arrives.
He sits close, his back to her.
SOMEONE's expression softens as she stares towards the windows, one hand tucked behind her head.
She rolls her head to face him.
SOMEONE sits up, her long hair hanging loose around her shoulders.
SOMEONE turns over his shoulder to meet her gaze.
Wearing a vulnerable frown, she takes a deep breath.
SOMEONE slumps regretfully then puts his arms around her.
The aging couple lies back on the bed in a warm embrace.
SOMEONE fingers SOMEONE's toy sword as SOMEONE cups her hand in his.
SOMEONE hosts her in the dining room.
Now the attic door opens.
Light pours in past SOMEONE as he stands in the doorway staring at the now dust coated chest.
He crosses to it slowly taking out a key.
Unlocking it, he lifts the lid and gazes in.
SOMEONE pensively takes out his specialized ax and finds the silver along the blade untarnished.
Tipping it, he holds it firmly in both hands and regards it nostalgically.
SOMEONE slowly twirls the weapon in both hands.
Gaining confidence, he builds speed until the ax spins in a blur.
It slips from his grasp.
Bracing one hand on the chest, SOMEONE clenches a fist and softly pounds the chest lid.
In a battle tent.
Wearing his broad-brimmed hat, SOMEONE leans forward, his hands on a table.
With SOMEONE and SOMEONE.
In Gettysburg, SOMEONE strides to the open flap of his tent where SOMEONE stands post.
SOMEONE slides his pocket watch over a trajectory marked on a map. It becomes a locomotive speeding along a track in the darkness.
Sidling along the engine's outer railing.
SOMEONE reaches the front and wipes off the headlamp.
He climbs back into the engine car where SOMEONE writes in his journal.
Pausing, the President looks up at his old friend.
Heading further into the car, a soot-smeared SOMEONE catches SOMEONE watching him and pauses with a frown.
He shifts his gaze.
SOMEONE regards his old friend solemnly. A net of chains rattles over SOMEONE's head as he returns the gaze with a faint smile.
Removing a pair of spectacles, the President takes up his ax and turns away. Now on a narrow path in the woods, SOMEONE, SOMEONE and a few underlings approach on horseback. Facing them, Ms. Tubman stays SOMEONE who draws up her cloaks hood.
Riding ahead, SOMEONE passes Ms. Tubman and looms over SOMEONE on her horse.
She halts close to the First Lady who keeps her face hidden.
SOMEONE draws a long, slim blade and points it at her head.
She pushes her hood back a few inches.
SOMEONE reluctantly obeys.
SOMEONE stares as the vampires ride off from whence they came.
Behind the First Lady, dozens of African-Americans emerge from hiding with sacks and baskets.
They join SOMEONE on the path out of Washington.
Meanwhile, the locomotive races through the darkness.
Stepping into the car behind it, SOMEONE slides its door shut.
Stacks of crates fill both sides of the car.
Stepping past, SOMEONE pauses, raises his ax and turns.
From the engine, SOMEONE leans out a window and spots several vampires leaping onto the freight cars.
He lunges back into the car with a smile. In a freight car, SOMEONE loads his six-shooter with silver rounds.
Pausing, he looks up.
SOMEONE frowns and gets to his feet, readying his gun.
A lantern swings from its post over his head as he steps over the wood plank floor.
Turning, he raises his weapon.
He moves to a shuttered hatch and slides it open, aiming into the darkness.
SOMEONE slides it shut then turns to face another shuttered hatch. He takes aim and reaches out to open it.
Hands burst through the baseboards and grab his ankles. SOMEONE falls back and the vampire starts to pull him out.
He fires a gun in each hand then scrambles free.
SOMEONE limps to a crate.
As he looks up, a vampire leaps from the shadows. Grabbing his guns, SOMEONE fires taking him down. He puts his back to the wall and aims in either direction. Arms burst through the wood and hug him from behind. The wounded vampire rises, but SOMEONE shoots him through the forehead. His guns fall from his grasp as he struggles against the vampire holding him. He fights his way free then grabs a huge pistol and blows the monster away. The kickback sends SOMEONE to the floor beside the dead vampire. He opens a door behind the monster letting him fall away.
As he slides it shut, countless more vampires leap onto the roof. SOMEONE hobbles to another car.
SOMEONE goes.
Now between two rail cars.
SOMEONE glances at the barrel of his ax.
SOMEONE gives him a bullet then shakes his hand. SOMEONE heads back inside as his friend climbs up to the rail car's roof. Inside, SOMEONE stabs a vampire with a bayonet attached to the butt of his ax. He pulls the weapon out then ducks past another lapping off his head. On the roof, SOMEONE draws two pistols and shoots a vampire. In slow motion, the monster flies past him spraying blood. Another charges and SOMEONE fires. In slow motion, the shot rips through the vampire's shoulder.
Baring his fangs, he lunges at SOMEONE. SOMEONE flings him aside, but loses his balance nearly stepping over the roof's edge.
He regains his footing and hurries on to a vampire turning a hand wheel. Sparks fly from a wheel of the train. SOMEONE's guns misfire. The vampire bares his hideous fangs. SOMEONE lunges pushing the ghoul to the next rail car ahead.
Rising to his knees, he turns the hand wheel, disengaging the brake. Meanwhile, SOMEONE wedges his ax into a ceiling beam and dropkicks a vampire away. He goes to finish his enemy but finds only shards of wood on the floor.
The vampire jumps on his back. Forced toward an open door, SOMEONE braces himself with his ax. The vampire tries to bite his neck, but he flips his foe out of the rail car decapitating him as he shuts the door. The vampire's head lies at his feet. SOMEONE boots it out. On the roof, still turning the hand wheel, SOMEONE watches his enemy rise to his feet.
SOMEONE turns his head.
The vampire falls aside revealing SOMEONE standing halfway through a hatch, his modified ax in hand. SOMEONE spots a vampire climbing on to the roof. He grabs his partner's weapon and attacks the new arrival knocking the monster over the edge. He tosses the ax back to SOMEONE who chops into another. With SOMEONE's blade stuck in his fallen foe, a vampire attacks with kicks and punches. As SOMEONE fends off the attacker, SOMEONE lifts his ax, twirls it, releasing a spray of blood, then slashes off the vampire's head. In the same swing, he strikes another vampire's midsection. He massacres another, slashing his face several times, then passes the ax to SOMEONE. SOMEONE takes out two vampires then twirls the ax behind his back to SOMEONE who spins the versatile weapon and strikes another vampire with its butt. Through a veil of wind-swept steam, SOMEONE vanquishes yet another vampire. He brings his ax down once more.
The steam dissipates to reveal SOMEONE clutching the ax handle. He kicks SOMEONE, sending the President back. SOMEONE lands between the railcars in a tangle of chains. SOMEONE breaks the ax-handle over his knee. As SOMEONE climbs back onto the roof, SOMEONE hurls a knife.
The knife's tip nears SOMEONE's face, but the calm vampire tilts his head and dodges the blade. SOMEONE charges SOMEONE, but gets knocked off his feet.
As he slides head first over the edge, SOMEONE grabs his ankle.
Revolvers fall from the dangling man's pockets. As the train speeds alongside a wall, SOMEONE nearly crashes into some jutting rocks.
SOMEONE clutches SOMEONE's collar.
SOMEONE sinks his teeth into flesh, but finds himself biting SOMEONE's arm.
He kicks off the passing rock wall and lands facing his rival. As SOMEONE ducks a punch, the pair gets jostled atop the last railcar. Meanwhile, SOMEONE exhales a puff of thick smoke.
With a match, she lights a rope sending flames up a beam.
As she marches off, a massive fire consumes the entire support structure of a bridge. SOMEONE catches SOMEONE's arm then flips him. Grabs his leg and slams him through the roof. With an avalanche of broken wood, the vampires crash land on the floor of the railcar. SOMEONE rises to his feet and slams SOMEONE's face through the top of a wooden crate.
SOMEONE lifts the laughing vampire from the box then shoves him aside and peeks in the hole himself.
He pulls out a common rock.
Then looks up from the stone with a knowing gaze.
He tosses the rock and crosses to another crate. Inspecting the cargo, he finds more rocks in place of the silver.
SOMEONE angrily paces away. He kicks open another crate, spilling rocks on the floor.
SOMEONE boots SOMEONE back into a corner. The evil vampire glares.
As the train nears the burning bridge, SOMEONE eyes the blaze from the locomotive. He pulls back a lever, uses a piece of wood to keep it in place then leaves the controls. He enters the first railcar and staggers past the dummy cargo.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE helps SOMEONE onto the roof. They rise to their feet and spot the burning bridge up ahead. They start for the locomotive but stop short.
They turn back.
They run back across the rooftops.
Making his way through the railcars, SOMEONE finds a floor strewn with broken wood. He spots SOMEONE unconscious on his back, then looks up through the open ceiling.
Turning around, he finds himself face to face with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE's throat.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive to see SOMEONE bite into SOMEONE's neck.
The vampire looks up at them. Now, as the train passes over the burning bridge, the track splits and the last railcar breaks loose from the train. Left behind, the railcar teeters over a ledge sending SOMEONE and SOMEONE sliding down its roof. About to fall into the blaze below, they daringly leap across the divide and land on the next rail car's roof.
As what's left of the train races onward, the burning bridge collapses in its wake. Jostling inside a railcar, SOMEONE braces himself and SOMEONE rises to his knees. Their railcar breaks free from the train crashing into the support structure below the track.
SOMEONE leaves the downed railcar. Emerging from thick smoke, he crosses the support structure and kicks out a beam.
The track under the last railcar gives out and the railcar flips forward forcing SOMEONE and SOMEONE to run on to the next. SOMEONE kicks out another support beam. SOMEONE and SOMEONE fall to the structure under the track then hurry along its beams.
SOMEONE looks back.
SOMEONE marches towards them.
He vanishes. SOMEONE slings the silver pocket watch's chain around his fingers.
He drives his fist through the vampire's chest then pulls it out awash with blood. His mouth agape, SOMEONE falls flat on his back.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE notice the track collapsing above them. Each clings to a pillar as the locomotive lands on the lower level. They jump into the open trailer of the locomotive's coal car. As the remaining bridge buckles, the locomotive struggles to climb the increasingly inclined track. SOMEONE peeks over the side glimpsing the burning structure underneath. He and SOMEONE make their way across the engine. The locomotive’s wheels spin kicking up sparks. Before the engine reaches the end, the bridge underneath it splits from the final portion of the track. SOMEONE and SOMEONE brace themselves, clinging to the engine. More sparks fly as the train begins to slide backward. Just before it slips off the edge, the locomotive starts to climb the angled track.
A massive black cloud of smoke rises from the abyss and blots out our view of the play.
Drawing back, we find SOMEONE lying on the twisted end of the track.
SOMEONE hobbles over to him.
He reaches out and gives him a hand.
The President helps his mentor to his feet, then they both remain hunched over, catching their breath.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE look at SOMEONE.
In the daytime, at a bustling military camp, SOMEONE opens a box filled with silver blades.
She joins a few soldiers at another.

SOMEONE runs down a long staircase between the crowded tiers of rundown homes.
As some of his gunmen give chase, SOMEONE talks into his radio.
SOMEONE dashes down the stairs with the three gunmen close behind.
Rounding a corner, she navigates a labyrinth of alleyways. As she nears the end of one alley, her gaze falls on a metal fire escape ladder against the side of an apartment building.
Stepping onto a stack of wooden crates, she grabs the first rung.
She climbs up as the beefy thug arrives in the alley.
He spots her feet disappearing over the rooftop's edge.

Cars and pedestrians take little notice as they bustle past the dirty faced girl in her sullied school uniform.
Later, she reaches a building surrounded by a tall wrought iron fence.
Armed soldiers stand posted at its gate.
Consulting the business card from her father,
the dazed girl walks toward one of the security guards.
She offers the card.
Now inside, a man reads a name on it - John C. Davies, Embassy of the United States of America. He gazes at SOMEONE who sits in front of his desk.
As SOMEONE averts her gaze, the American leans closer.
She lifts her eyes to his then glances at an older man at a desk nearby.
Taking a deep breath, she sticks a finger down her throat.
He recoils as she barfs on his desk.
Wiping her mouth, she settles back into her seat and uses one finger to poke around the vomit.
She finds the computer chip and holds it out.
He grabs a tissue.
Grimacing, he uses it to take the chip.
His older colleague watches in disbelief as he cleans it off and places it in a disk which he then inserts into his computer.

which sits beside a row of windows at her eye level.

Eating her breakfast, the little girl shakes her head.
She looks up at her uncle with a resolute gaze.
SOMEONE leans back in his chair and takes a deep breath through parted lips.
He stares at her then affects a casual gaze.
His brow furrowed, he plants his hands on the table
and shares a brief uneasy look with his mother.
Now SOMEONE leads SOMEONE up the steps to a school's entrance.
Later in a principal's office, an elegant woman with blonde curls opens a stuffed yellow envelope.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit facing her.
She presents a folded paper to the girl.
The principal stands.
She smiles down at the girl who coldly gets to her feet.
As SOMEONE leads her out, the principal sinks back down in her chair and lets out a nervous sigh. Outside.
Turning, he finds SOMEONE standing motionless.
He nods and glances around.
He thrusts SOMEONE's backpack at her, draws a huge handgun and opens fire on a passing car.
It swerves off the road and hits a fire hydrant, knocking it from it base.
As fearful bystanders scatter, SOMEONE angrily faces his niece.

He crouches before the girl.
He snatches her backpack.
He holds out the gun and the backpack.

As he puts it back on. 
SOMEONE turns his niece away by the shoulder.
Keeping his arm around her, he saunters off casually down the sidewalk.
Now as we peer across a sprawling suburb, words appear.
California, 15 years later.
In a parking lot, a cop brings lunch to his partner.
A red muscle car plows into their cruiser.
Its door opens and an empty vodka bottle tumbles to the pavement.
A slender woman in a slinky mini dress staggers out.
The cops accost her.
They bend her over her car's hood and cuff her.
She wears the orchid pendant.
Now the cops drag SOMEONE through a police station booking room.
She stumbles and one of her shoes slips off.
A portly desk sergeant looks up at her approach.
The cops sit her down in front of him.
She slumps over, her long black bangs covering her face.
One of the cops retrieves her shoe and hands it to the sergeant then nudges her up.
The sergeant looks through her purse.
She rests her head on the desk.
She tries to take some candy but he snatches it away.
She dry heaves.
As the cops haul her off, the sergeant sets her abandoned shoes on his desk.
Now a bus pulls up in an alley.
Men in US Marshall vests march into view.
A bald mustached SOMEONE leads a team escorting a hooded prisoner.
He grabs a thermos. Now at a cell.
A SOMEONE unhoods a hatchet faced man with wild black hair.
The prisoner starts to enter the cell then pauses.
He takes gum from his mouth and sticks it on Warren's badge.
The SOMEONE smiles.
He leaves the gum on a crossbar then shuts the door.
He leaves the coffee thermos with the young SOMEONE.
Now a heavyset female guard brings a mug with a spoon in it to a cell where SOMEONE snores on a cot.
The guard leaves the mug on a crossbar.
As she leaves, the cell block lights blink out.
SOMEONE promptly sits up.
Reaching into her shaggy black locks, she pulls out a small hairpin.
Next she removes her wig, gathers her real hair at the back of her head and ties it in a bun.
From beneath her skirt, she rolls down a pair of black leggings.
She stands up, peels off the dress,
removes her bra, and pulls up a stretchy top attached to the leggings.
Kneeling to the cell door, she picks the lock with her hairpin then tucks it back into her bun.
She stands up, slides the cell door open and eyes a surveillance camera posted in a corner.
In a security room, a guard reads a newspaper, ignorning several monitors set up before him.
Back in the cell block, SOMEONE pivots the camera.
At his station, the guard turns on a portable radio.
He sets it by a monitor showing a view of a shadowy wall, then obliviously picks up his newspaper again.
In the female cell block, SOMEONE takes the spoon from the mug.
She presses a red button on the wall.
She slowly opens a door, slips out and shuts it behind her.
Creeping stealthily down a hallway, she reaches a break area.
She pads across the floor to a water cooler and fills a clear plastic cup.
Bubbles gurgle up into the water tank.
SOMEONE cautiously scans her surroundings as she backs away, then faces a door labeled Electrical Room.
She slips in and opens a cabinet revealing circuit breakers.
She sets the water on top then climbs a table and opens an air duct on the ceiling.
Next, she returns to the cabinet and balances the spoon in the circuit breaker.
She bites a tiny hole in the water cup
then sets it above the spoon.
Eyeing her wristwatch, she pushes a button.
She shuts the cabinet,
climbs into the air duct, and pulls up the vent cover.
From a hole in the cup, a drop of water escapes.
It lands in the spoon which dips slightly.
SOMEONE crawls through the air duct as more water weighs down the spoon.
Reaching a grated cover, she peers down at a male prisoner asleep in his cell.
As she crawls on by, he wakes.
SOMEONE reaches a large ventilation fan and checks her watch.
The spoon falls and the water shorts out the fan.
At his desk, the sergeant looks up.
In the air duct, the fan slows to a stop.
SOMEONE lies on her back and slithers her feet between the blades.
Below, Doyle shuffles into the electrical room and eyes the circuit cabinet.
A red light glows on its door.
In the duct, SOMEONE slides her chest between the blades then squeezes her arms down her to side.
Doyle opens the cabinet as she works her shoulders through the fan.
He flips a reset switch.
SOMEONE emerges safely on the other side just as the fan whirs back to life.

In the secure cell block, SOMEONE finds his coffee thermos empty.
He checks on SOMEONE.
Finding the prisoner asleep, he shuffles to the cell block door and pushes a button.
He wakes the guard in the security room.
He buzzes SOMEONE through.
Later in a men's room, the young SOMEONE sets the thermos on a sink and crosses to a urinal.
As he relieves himself, SOMEONE slips out of the stall and creeps up behind him.
She kicks him as he turns, knocking him out cold.
Now in the security room.
A monitor shows SOMEONE standing at the door to the secure cell block with his face hidden by his arshal's cap.
The guard buzzes him through.
As the door opens, the unconscious SOMEONE sinks to his knees then falls face down.
Crouched in the hallway, SOMEONE creeps in after him and gently pushes the door shut.
She takes SOMEONE's gun.
Checking the clip, she finds it fully loaded.
She stands, holding the weapon pointed at the floor, and moves to SOMEONE's cell.
The prisoner sleeps sprawled on the cot.
SOMEONE slides the door open and saunters in.
She leans over SOMEONE, pointing the gun at his chest.
Tilting her head, she nudges the barrel against his brow.

Meanwhile, SOMEONE kicks open a grated vent cover leading her outside.
In the alley, officers run past the prison bus. Several stories above, SOMEONE climbs out of the duct and clings to the wall. The officers hurry up a set of emergency access stairs. SOMEONE stretches her leg up to a shoulder high ledge. As she climbs, the officers arrive on the rooftop.
She reaches the top ledge.
Her feet scramble up the brick wall, propelling her over.
Landing in a crouch, she spots the police across the rooftop.
She breaks into a sprint.
Crossing to the roof's edge, she leaps over and grabs onto a pipe just beneath the other side.
Her toes touch down on a slim ledge.
She starts to reach up but withdraws her hand as an officer arrives above her.
He sweeps his flashlight over the edge.
Flattening herself against the wall, SOMEONE evades his detection.
The cop leaves and she pulls herself up.
Her legs accidentally sweep tiny bits of mortar off the ledge.
The SOMEONE lands behind two cops in an alley who turn and look up.
SOMEONE pulls herself into an air duct as an officer comes over.
Back in the women's cell block, she kicks open a ceiling vent cover and lowers herself to the floor.
She hurries to her cell and shuts herself in.
The heavyset female officer arrives with SOMEONE Warren and his men.
He stops at SOMEONE's cell.
Back in her party girl disguise, she lies curled up on her cot.
SOMEONE Warren turns away and faces the desk sergeant.
He leads the local police out of the cell block.
SOMEONE's eyes open and she rolls over.
Now a middle aged man in a dark suit squints in the sunlight as he steps off a private jet.
Accompanied by a small team of associates, he meets SOMEONE Warren and his men.
We glimpse an FBI jacket as the two teams approach a pair of waiting SUVs.
Now in a morgue, a body bag lies on a slab.
Agent SOMEONE opens it, revealing SOMEONE's chest.
He eyes the markings then faces a tall powerfully built colleague.
He glances at SOMEONE Warren who nods.

Reporters and photographers swarm them as they walk upstairs to the open front door.
SOMEONE slips out unnoticed.
The station doors shut as she reaches the sidewalk and peels a rubbery substance off her right hand.
Passing between two parked press vans,
she drops it on the pavement.
Now SOMEONE Warren watches, arms folded, as SOMEONE stands in SOMEONE's cell.
Facing the cop, the FBI agent aims an imaginary gun and visualizes the murdered criminal.
He looks up with a furrowed brow at the sizable vent cover
then peers down at the cot again and backs up toward the cell door.
He steps out of the cell and notices the surveillance camera.
Now a video camera captures SOMEONE entering a lobby. She discreetly brushes her hair over her face as she crosses the polished floor. Glass doors behind her show a bus parked at a curb.
She enters an employee locker room.
She opens a locker, and pulls out a purse and a travel bag.
Now she enters a bathroom stall.
She removes her wig and lets down her hair,
then kicks off her high heeled party girl shoes and wriggles out of the tight mini dress.
Later, the stall door swings open.
A blonde woman turns from a mirror as a now casually dressed SOMEONE emerges.
The assassin steps out into the hall and looks both ways.
She puts on a floppy knit hat then strides off.
At home, SOMEONE answers a cordless phone. On the other end, SOMEONE stands at a payphone.
She hangs up, runs to the bus, and turns in her ticket.
In an FBI office.
Now a black luxury car approaches a mansion nestled among palm trees.

SOMEONE arrives at his side and leans against a pillar.
In Chicago, our view soars over skyscrapers.
Inside Union Station, SOMEONE walks down stairs into the sunlit great hall.
She pauses, most of her hair tucked under a hat and her features disguised by large sunglasses pushing them up on her nose, she crosses the sunny atrium.
Now she enters an apartment.
Two walls of frosted glass make a small foyer. SOMEONE pauses cautiously.
then shuts the door.
SOMEONE goes to a table, and puts down her things.
She pulls off her hat then removes her flannel shirt,
revealing a loose fitting tank top.
Brushing back her long hair, she opens a brown paper bag.
She takes out a cup of noodles. She eats some with her hands as she crosses to a complex media console
where she turns on a set of security monitors.
Scanning the feeds, she plucks out some more noodles, tilts her head back, then drops some into her mouth.
She sets the cup down then claps her hands and raises her arms above her head.
The live young assassin swivels her hips with sensual grace as she dances her way into a living area.
To her right, a large square painting depicting a pink SOMEONE orchid at the center of a gold rimmed medallion stands propped against the wall.
She looks at it for a moment then dances away.
In a cage, a finch on a perch ruffles its feathers as its owner sashays across the room.
SOMEONE sets down a handgun.
Now we watch from overhead as she gets into the shower.
She plants her hands on the wall and bows her head.
Water drips from her pendant then streams down her nose, lips, and chin.
She briskly soaps up her flawless skin and shifts her weary gaze.

He cautiously looks down the hall then steps into a dark apartment.
A single lamp shines on sketches taped all over the walls
and candles burn throughout the cluttered space.
The man steps further in, passing an electric fan and a jar of paintbrushes.
He halts and turns around to find SOMEONE watching him from a leather sofa.
She switches on the lights.
She smiles, springs up, and greets him with a hungry kiss.
His arms envelope her and his hands travel down her back.
SOMEONE abruptly ends the kiss and faces a stylized portrait of an old man.
SOMEONE peels off his jacket then removes her own as she resumes their embrace.
SOMEONE gently takes hold of her wrists.
Grinning, she pulls her dress off over her head to reveal her black bra and matching panties.
She plants a kiss on SOMEONE's lips then removes his t-shirt.
His tattooed arms wrap around her
and he lifts her up.
SOMEONE's legs grip his waist as he carries her to the sofa.
He sits with her straddling his lap.
She lifts her head ecstatically and tilts it side to side as the handsome artist nibbles her neck and kisses her chest.
Now he sleeps curled up in bed while SOMEONE lies awake at his side.
She gingerly sits up.
She puts on her bra.
Padding into the living area, she picks her dress up off the floor and pulls it on.
In bed, sunlight shines softly on SOMEONE's sleeping form.
He reaches an arm behind him.
His hand hits SOMEONE's side of the bed and finds it unoccupied.
Now in a humble Chicago neighborhood, SOMEONE rides a red motorcycle with chrome trim.
Turning, he pulls up onto a sidewalk and parks beneath an overhanging roof at a building's entrance.
He steps inside a laundromat through a pair of glass doors covered in newspaper.
He glances at a blonde woman who sits reading near a similarly blanketed window.
Looking around, he moves to a coin operated washing machine and starts a load.
He sits down.
SOMEONE sits beside him.
SOMEONE shows a magazine cover featuring a portly bald man.
She accepts an envelope stuffed with large bills.
Gathering up her bags, she pauses and turns. SOMEONE holds up a newspaper clipping.
An article on SOMEONE Rizzo's death shows a photo of the orchid design on his chest.
SOMEONE gives a weary shrug then leans forward and rests his elbows on his legs.
Our focus shifts to his niece as she leans forward as well.
SOMEONE avoids her gaze.
She reaches out a dainty hand and affectionately wraps it around one of his fingers.
Now in the FBI office, Agent SOMEONE studies a transparency of SOMEONE's drawing.
The office mail man notices it.
Agent SOMEONE sets down the transparency and types at his computer.
An image of the orchid appears.
The agent holds up the drawing and finds that it matches perfectly.
He types some more and turns up a map of Amazonia.
A message appears, "Access denied."
He sits back in his chair.
Now SOMEONE approaches two caged mastiffs.
She enters their fenced in area.
She shows a steak.
She places a steak in each of their bowls.
Stepping out from the cage, she closes the door and gives them a firm look.
The mastiffs rush to their bowls.
Nearby, a long haired mechanic works on a car. SOMEONE touches a wind chime made from tire rims as she enters the garage.
She kisses Pepe's cheek.
She opens a tall safe standing against a wall.
Taking out a stack of money, she fans through it
then examines four different passports and settles on a Mexican one.
Now our view glides over a mansion with a Paris styled courtyard at its center.
A bodyguard patrols the estate with an automatic rifle.
A woman in sexy lingerie reclines on top of a pool enclosed in glass panels.
Sharks swim in the water beneath her.
Lounging with two women, the SOMEONE laughs.
That night, four women in their underwear accompany him to a bedroom. He turns to a bodyguard.
SOMEONE winks and pats the guard's face, then turns to the women who pillow fight on his canopy bed.
He frames his crotch with his hands then hurries over and belly flops onto the bed.
Outside, a van pulls into the estate and stops in front of the mansion.
Several bodyguards get out and SOMEONE approaches them.
The bodyguards file into the mansion.
As SOMEONE supervises the men, SOMEONE rolls out from the under the van just before it pulls away.
The head security guard steps into the mansion and closes the door.
SOMEONE scurries to another entrance and creeps into a dark foyer.
An oblivious bodyguard stands at a window holding a handgun.
In the courtyard, a guard puffs on a cigarette then heads inside.
A view through the pool's glass panels shows a shark gliding through the pale blue water.
As it swims away, a hand appears under the glass.
Wearing a black short sleeved leotard and a utility belt, SOMEONE pulls herself along the panels.
Two sharks swim nearby paying little attention to the graceful intruder.
SOMEONE nears the opposite end of the pool and pushes up one of the thick glass panels.
Gripping its edge, she slides it away.
Her head breaks the water's surface and she peers into the courtyard.
Pushing herself out of the pool, she draws a gun at her hip.
She glances around as she screws a silencer onto its barrel.
With her fingers curled around the gun's handle, she hurries into the mansion.
In his bedroom, the portly scam artist sleeps amid his scantily clad companions.
SOMEONE marches quietly toward the bed, water still glistening on her slender neck.
She carries the gun at her side, her finger crooked around the trigger.
Halting a few yards from the foot of the bed, she regards the Ponzi schemer with a cold determined gaze.
As she aims her weapon, a blonde snuggles up to the portly man in her sleep
draping herself across his chest.
Our view arcs around SOMEONE's gun until the silencer muzzle aims right at us.
A bright golden flash clouds our view.
SOMEONE bolts upright then looks down at his bare chest.
He finds the words thief written in black lipstick above a drawing of the SOMEONE orchid.
With his brow creased worriedly, he tries to rub it off
then glances around and scoots off the bed.
In the hall, he finds a bodyguard lying on the floor with a pool of blood by his head.
Another guard lies dead beside him.
Staring cautiously, SOMEONE grabs a gun resting in one of men's hands.
His bare legs tremble slightly as he moves down a dark corridor past another dead bodyguard.
He creeps down a flight of stairs, then presses his back to a wall as he reaches the bottom.
Bending over another dead bodyguard, he takes his gun.
Armed with a pistol in each hand, he steps into the courtyard.
He notices a flower resting three panels away on the pool's glass.
His nervous eyes scan the area as he walks across the pool.
Stopping in front of the SOMEONE orchid, he picks it up and squints as he examines it.
He lifts the flower to his nose, closes his eyes, and takes a sniff.
Opening his eyes, he smirks as he lifts his face from the flower.
SOMEONE rises from a chair in the portico behind him.
SOMEONE shakes his head as he turns to face her.
He fires one gun then the other but finds them both empty.
She shoots him in his leg and he sinks to one knee.
A shot to his other leg sends him down on all fours.
He glances at the sharks below him.
SOMEONE shoots him in the shoulder and he tumbles into the uncovered gap in the panel.
As the sharks attack, he flails and grabs futily at the glass.
His blood billows in the water.
Walking onto the glass, SOMEONE picks up the orchid and drops it into the pool.
In his office, SOMEONE reads a newspaper's front page.
A photo displays the bloody swimming pool and a caption reads, "Sharks eat shark."
With a scowl, SOMEONE answers his phone.
He slams down the receiver.
Agent SOMEONE hangs up. Now a plane soars overhead.
Later at an airport, a woman and a goateed man follow SOMEONE past a baggage claim area.
SOMEONE pockets his cellphone.
He and his two bodyguards stride outside to a pick up area where a car awaits.
He climbs into the front passenger seat.
Now SOMEONE descends a staircase from a train platform.
As a man passes, she bows her head, letting her hair shield her face.
Later, she enters SOMEONE's apartment.
Walking past easels and paint supplies,
she spots the painting of the elderly man resting off to the side.
A drop cloth covers half of the canvas.
SOMEONE reads a note written in a sketchbook.
She slides off her jacket and falls back on his bed.
Her fingers fidgets with the orchid pendant around her neck.
as she stares up at the ceiling.
She turns on to her side, adjusting the pillow under her head
and notices one of SOMEONE's shirts lying on top of the covers.
Lifting it to her face, she smells it
then draws it into her arms and clutches it against her chest.
At the FBI office.
Two clips show SOMEONE at the police station, her face obscured.
Agent SOMEONE hits a command on his computer then sips from a travel mug.
As a laser like line scans down the image of SOMEONE, a message on the monitor blinks, "Morphological analysis."
A data match calculator runs above 13%.
At night, lights from Chicago's skyscrapers glimmer on the horizon.
In SOMEONE's apartment, SOMEONE pours red wine into a glass.
Lit candles around the room give it a warm glow.
SOMEONE glances over as her artist boyfriend comes home. She breaks into a smile.
She offers a glass.
She gives him a kiss then takes his hand.
He gazes at food on a nearby table then sits facing her.
From a bag, she produces a plush alligator and hands it to him.
Smiling, she steps closer.
She kisses SOMEONE lustfully, running her fingers through his hair.
He gently pushes her away and she takes a seat in front of him.
SOMEONE looks away.
She stares off, her eyes shining with tears.
then gives a small shake of her head.
Blinking her woeful eyes, she opens her mouth to speak
then turns away and rests her elbow on the table.
She leans her head on her hands.
Tilting her head, she rumples her lips then grazes them with her fingers as her eyes fill with tears.
She glances back at SOMEONE
who flashes a tight smile.
SOMEONE breaks into a grin.
She leans closer and presses her lips to SOMEONE's.
As her kisses grow more passionate,
SOMEONE grabs her arms and holds her at bay.
Under his steady gaze, she gives a yielding look.
She raises her arms letting him lift off her shirt. He sets it aside. With both hands, he brushes SOMEONE's hair away from her face,
then leans forward and places a gentle peck on her cheek.
As he sprinkles her with more kisses,
she nuzzles her head against his. The next morning, the stuffed alligator sits on a table in front of a tray holding glasses of orange juice,
coffee mugs, and two plates of food.
Spotting the plush gift, SOMEONE picks it up.
He glances toward the bedroom where SOMEONE lies asleep under rumpled covers.
Grabbing his phone, he heads over and gazes down at the slumbering beauty.
He snaps a photo.
He dances the alligator in front of SOMEONE.
She jumps up.
She dresses.
SOMEONE looks out a window with a frustrated look.
Now SOMEONE strides down an aisle in a used book store.
Turning a corner,
she finds SOMEONE reading a newspaper.
He hurls the newspaper at her.
She lowers her gaze to a headline.
He presses her against a shelf.
He starts to leave.
He pauses.
He turns and glares at her.
She wipes away tears as he steps over to her.
He slaps a folded paper into her palm, wraps her fingers around it, and presses it to her chest.
As he leaves, she opens the paper and sees it's an old photo of herself with her parents.
Cupping a hand over her mouth, she sits on a bench then kicks the shelf in front of her.
She hangs her head.
Her shoulders tremble.
Now rain pours on a small cafe across the street from us.
His friend's eyes light up.
He shows the photo on his cell.
He spots a meter maid by his car.
He hurries outside.
His friend grabs his left behind phone off the table and makes a call with it.
In a police station, SOMEONE pulls it up on her computer.
She types. Her computer runs the photo through a database.
SOMEONE hangs up then glances outside at his friend.
He sets the cellphone back on the table.
In the FBI office, a message appears on Agent SOMEONE's computer, "Alert, database, new element."
He makes a phone call.
He hangs up and types a command into his computer.
A satellite map of Chicago appears then zooms in several times.
The trace hones in on a building and a label reads, "Third Precinct, Chicago, Illinois."
Agent SOMEONE makes another phone call.
In Chicago, we soar through the tall buildings, skimming a white steeple set with a gold cross.
In the spacious cathedral, congregants fill the pews.
Among them sit SOMEONE and Mama who murmurs a prayer under her breath.
SOMEONE arrives
wearing her large sunglasses.
Sitting beside her great-aunt, she stares ahead coldly.
Mama watches her remove her sunglasses.
The older woman turns to face SOMEONE who keeps his gaze fixed forward.
A tear streams down Mama's cheek and she shakily suppresses a sob.
SOMEONE's gaze softens.
As she lays her head on the old woman's shoulder, Mama nuzzles against her and closes her eyes.
SOMEONE smiles.
Later, he drives Mama.
Pepe rides with them.
SOMEONE parks at a curb and gets out.

Agent SOMEONE and his powerfully built colleague briskly march away.
Now a low sun casts a golden glow in the sky over Chicago.
In her apartment, SOMEONE soaks forlornly in a tub.
One arm dangles over the side holding a lit cigarette.
She drops it in a glass of water.
At his apartment, SOMEONE brings up his photo of SOMEONE on his phone.
He smiles fondly.
His display reads, "Unknown number."
The FBI listens in.
He knocks on a wall.
They're in a van followed by a police car.

A surveillance feed shows the SWAT truck arriving outside. The team storms the building.
She drops her cell and rummages through a drawer.
Outside, SOMEONE puts on a bulletproof vest.
SOMEONE finds a key then takes a handgun from a table's underside.
Rushing through the apartment,
she turns on the shower then opens the birdcage.
She peeks out her apartment door into the hall.
In the lobby, SOMEONE takes an elevator. SWAT officers climb a stairwell.
SOMEONE runs barefoot down the hall, gun in hand.
As the elevator approaches the 11th floor, Agent SOMEONE draws his gun.
SOMEONE reaches a stairwell and descends just as the elevator arrives.
Two SWAT officers cautiously scope out the area.
In the stairwell, SOMEONE pauses briefly, looking down.
Meanwhile, the SWAT team accompanying SOMEONE reaches her apartment door.
Agent SOMEONE arrives in another corridor with more gunmen.
From the stairwell, SOMEONE evades the ascending SWAT team by ducking into a hallway.
She races to a door, unlocks it, and slips into a living room where a long haired man watches TV.
He bolts up as she enters.
She slams his head against a coffee table, knocking him out.
Her gun ready, she proceeds to a bathroom,
climbs up on the rim of the tub and lifts a ceiling tile.
In a hallway.

attaching the smaller ones to a belt around her waist.
She sets a charge on the tiled wall and pushes a button.
Taking up her enormous rifle, she marches down her neighbor's hallway.
She pauses by the door and raises a detonator.
At Agent SOMEONE's command, the apartment door explodes. A fire ball blossoms out from the unit and rolls down the hall.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE punches her detonator.
A fiery blast rips a hole in the bathroom wall.
Agent SOMEONE stands calmly in an elevator that jostles with the force of the explosion.
In the neighbor's apartment, the flames quickly fill the bathroom
then lap into the hall where SOMEONE takes cover.
Both fires die down.
The SWAT team enters her apartment while she approaches the fresh hole in the wall.
Agent SOMEONE waves smoke out of his face.
In the bathroom, SOMEONE uses a cable to lower her rifle down a now exposed shaft.
In her apartment,
Agent SOMEONE notices the empty birdcage then the orchid painting.

Now a vent cover flies loose and a bare foot steps out.
SOMEONE crawls out from the shaft.
In an elevator, Agent SOMEONE speaks into his radio.
SOMEONE eyes monitors in the lobby.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE shoots out a camera.
Now sweat glistens on SOMEONE's skin as she pads briskly through the garage.

A SWAT Humvee arrives in the garage with its lights flashing, trailed by two police cruisers.

Meanwhile, SOMEONE arrives in a changing room and checks a set of lockers.
She finds one unlocked and opens it.
Now as a subway train moves through the tunnel, a uniform clad SOMEONE slips out onto a catwalk above it.
A worker mends a track below as she creeps along,
her rifle bundled in a large sack.
She strides up a walkway toward daylight.
Later, she arrives at SOMEONE's house.
She halts at the sight of an unfinished cigar on a side table.
Drawing a handgun, she proceeds through the foyer.
She heads upstairs.
Nearing the top, she finds Pepe's shattered sunglasses lying on the second floor, inches from his limp hand.
She aims her gun upward then ventures on.
Reaching the kitchen, she bursts into tears.
She kneels down to the old woman's crumpled body beside the overturned table and chair.
SOMEONE scrambles to her feet,
raises her gun and rushes through the house.
Reaching a doorway, she stops and slumps against the frame.
Her arms sink to her sides as she stares ahead.
She shuffles through a living room to a sitting room.
In front of her, a bloody SOMEONE sits tied to a chair, his head drooped forward.
The gun drops from her hand.
She moves closer, She sinks down before her murdered uncle, and sobs against his shoulder.
She buries her face in his lap.
In the FBI office, Agent SOMEONE thoughtfully stares at a SOMEONE orchid
as he turns it in his fingers.
Now he leaves.
At a store, he buys a frozen dinner.
Later, he passes a neighbor walking his dog.
The agent heads through an iron security gate and approaches the entrance of a brownstone building.
Now he arrives in a modest apartment. He sets his gun and badge in a drawer.
He wearily takes his frozen dinner to the kitchen and puts it tray in the microwave.
Turning, he finds SOMEONE standing nearby in the shadows with her handgun pointed at him.
He sits as she shows the disconnected cameras.
With a sad smile, she lowers her gun.
Agent SOMEONE looks down. A wired timer blinks under his seat.
SOMEONE nods.
She pulls out a newspaper clipping and tearfully holds it out.
It includes a photo of SOMEONE.
She shakes her head with a sorrowful childlike pout
then shows a photo on a cellphone.
She takes a framed photo from a shelf and stares down at it.
She puts the photo back.
It shows Agent SOMEONE with his wife and two young children.
She turns away.
She halts in the kitchen, her weary gaze cast downward.
She starts the microwave then leaves.
Agent SOMEONE glances at his chair.
The microwave timer ticks down to zero.
Agent SOMEONE stands up quickly,
spins around, and leans his hands on the seat.
He springs back safely.
At the CIA, he throws down a file.
He gives the FBI agent a cold smirk. SOMEONE turns away.
SOMEONE smiles behind his back as he answers his cell.
Listening to the caller, he looks out the windows as he makes his way back to SOMEONE's desk.
A red laser point appears on SOMEONE's chest. He responds with a sneer.

A bullet pierces the glass and hits a photo of SOMEONE with President SOMEONE W. Bush.

Now beneath a hazy sky, we soar over Chicago's skyscrapers.
SOMEONE arrives in Pepe's garage and slides a pair of chain link doors open.
She removes a locker's padlock,
takes out a selection of rifles, and sets them on a worktable.
The assassin loads a clip into an assault rifle
then shuts a weapons case.
As she loads an armored truck, she notices the dogs watching her.
SOMEONE shifts her gaze then looks back at the dogs.
Now the truck's headlights switch on and the vehicle pulls out of its spot.
With SOMEONE at the wheel, it smashes through a gate and out onto the street.
At twilight, the truck splashes through puddles as it progresses down a narrow uneven alley.
Now as we peer down a hallway's polished floor, we find a portly bespectacled man marching toward us, a briefcase in hand.
He arrives at a door and passes through.
Its stenciled lettering reads, "Stanley J. SOMEONE, Chief Land Surveyor."
SOMEONE sits in his chair.
She aims a gun.
Now at the mansion.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze to an open door straight away and sees a rocket flying right at him.
He lunges sideways avoiding the projectile which explodes as it hits a wall.
A burst of roiling flames fills the room
then blasts out doors and windows.
A crystal chandelier crashes to the ground.
As the flames give way to a haze of smoke,
SOMEONE and SOMEONE's gunmen writhe.
Looking into the adjacent room, SOMEONE finds his boss unconscious on the floor.
He hurries over and starts to lift him.
The man stirs.
He stands.
With their weapons raised, four gunmen rush into a spacious garage.
Scurrying to a row of luxury cars, they climb into a Mercedes.
As it speeds toward the garage's exit, the armored truck backs through a wall beside it and smashes into the vehicle's nose.
It continues to reverse, driving over the Mercedes's hood and crushing it.
SOMEONE climbs out with a sub machine gun raised.
She fires at the car.
As the barrage of bullets kills the men inside, smoking casings pop out of her gun and shower the ground.
SOMEONE leads his boss away.
They turn down a corridor.
He pushes a statue on the wall.
A panel behind the statue pushes inward to reveal a hidden compartment.
SOMEONE closes himself inside.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE creeps through a crawl space under the mansion.
Dust sprinkles down through the floorboards above.
Pressing her back to a wall, she fires up through the floorboards.
As her shots hit a gunman, others take cover.
The shooting ceases and the bullet riddled man falls.
SOMEONE peers out from another room.
A beefy gunman shows him a grenade and the bearded gangster nods.
The gunman tosses it over and SOMEONE pulls its pin.
He lobs it into the other room where it lands beside the murdered gunman.
The explosion tears into the floor and churning fire surges through the crawl space.
SOMEONE watches from a safe distance as smoldering SOMEONE rains down.
In the hidden compartment, SOMEONE presses his ear to the panel
then takes out his cell and dials.
SOMEONE answers.
Stepping into the destroyed room, the beefy gunman fires down the hole in the floor
then jumps into the crawl space, his weapon still blasting.
More gunmen follow.
With the phone still to his ear, SOMEONE aims a handgun as he cautiously steps toward the hole.
SOMEONE gives a relieved look.
A burst of bullets hits the gunmen in the crawl space.
Hiding behind a pillar, SOMEONE lowers his phone.
On the opposite side of the room, SOMEONE stands on a mezzanine with a sub machine gun in each hand.
SOMEONE squeezes his eyes closed as her bullets hit the floor near his feet.
Her shots rip side by side paths of holes in the wood then lift to three gunmen in the adjacent room, killing one after another.
SOMEONE turns to the mezzanine and fires. SOMEONE races away.
As a thin gunman and a bald one shoot up at the mezzanine, SOMEONE rushes out of the room.
The bald gunman follows and the thin one takes cover behind a pillar.
Now alone, the thin gunman peers around his pillar at the mezzanine.
SOMEONE stands beside him holding a gun to his cheek.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE listens on his phone.
Now SOMEONE steps over the thin gunman's dead body and strides off.
Elsewhere in the mansion, SOMEONE and the bald gunman hurry into a bedroom.
As the gunman shuts the door and waits,
his weapon raised, SOMEONE closes himself into a bathroom.
SOMEONE talks into his cell.
The bearded gangster hangs up.
In the bedroom, the gunman grits his teeth as he stares at the door paned with textured glass.
SOMEONE sets his phone on a shelf by a tub and glances at the closed door.
He checks the chamber in his pistol then tosses the weapon on the floor.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE slumps against a wall in the compartment.
Setting his tinted glasses on the shelf, SOMEONE watches the bathroom door open.
SOMEONE enters with her gun raised.
As she kicks his pistol away, he grabs her wrist and redirects her aim.
She releases the weapon, catches it in her other hand, and points at him again.
He grabs its barrel and strikes her in the head, snatching it away as she stumbles.
He raises it and she grabs a glass off a shelf and hurls it at him.
She wraps a towel around his gun wielding wrist and pulls down as if operating a lever, using her own shoulder as a fulcrum to break his arm.
Yanking her ponytail back, SOMEONE wiggles out of her hold.
She whips the towel at his hand and knocks the gun into the tub.
As she whips at him, he dodges
then grabs the towel's other end.
She spins toward him, punches him in the throat, then kicks him.
Holding him against a wall, she strikes him over and over.
He shoves her away but she wraps the towel around his neck and starts to choke him from behind.
He backs her into a wall, breaks the hold, and hurls her aside.
As he grabs the gun from the tub, she knocks it to the floor. She kicks him in the groin.
Standing behind her, he wraps the towel around her neck and starts to choke her. Removing her belt, she flips it over her head, wraps it around the back of his neck, and faces him.
She swings him into a fireplace and they both tumble to the ground.
Pushing himself to his feet, SOMEONE moves to SOMEONE and pulls her hair. She grabs a toothbrush on the ground and stabs him with it.
As she picks up another, he yanks her to her feet.
She swipes at him with a brush in each hand.
He grabs her wrists, holding her back, but she twists free and slashes at him.
Spinning, she backhands him with one of the brushes.
He charges, grabbing her around the waist.
As she gets thrown against the wall, the brushes fall from her grasp.
She lands a punch, sending SOMEONE crumpling to the floor where he grabs the abandoned gun.
As he points it at SOMEONE, she quickly releases the weapon's magazine from its hand grip then yanks the slide from the barrel and stabs him in the neck with it.
His head droops.
SOMEONE withdraws her hand, trembling as she falls back in exhaustion.
She stares at the dead gangster.
The clip juts grotesquely from his neck.
A bloody nosed SOMEONE scoots back from him,
her body quivering with emotional sobs.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE shifts his panicked eyes, then opens the compartment's panel.
Back in the bathroom, SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE's phone.
SOMEONE races to the garage and gets into a van.
Spinning its wheel, he steers past the destroyed Mercedes
and squeezes between the armored truck and a wall, side swiping both on his way through.
He speeds out a door and onto a narrow road.
With a frantic look, he pulls onto the main road leading out of his estate, passes through the front gate and swerves onto a street.
The van fishtails, its spinning tires leaving a wake of churning dust.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE exits the mansion.
Turning a corner, SOMEONE finds the road blocked by a garbage truck.
He answers a phone on the van's dash.
Turning, SOMEONE sees her dogs in the back seat.
The dogs attack and blood splatters the phone.
A view from outside shows the van shaking.
Blinking her weary eyes, SOMEONE lowers her cell from her ear and sucks in an anguished breath.
A thin trickle of blood leads from one nostril
to the tip of her chin.
Warm sunlight washes over her face as she drops to her knees in the grass under a towering tree.
She bows her head.
Back in Chicago, SOMEONE sits with Agent SOMEONE in an office at the FBI.
Agent SOMEONE heads to the door.
As he leaves, SOMEONE gives a perturbed look.
Checking his phone's display, he glances around then answers.
The agent hurries off.
SOMEONE tears up. Agent SOMEONE enters the office.
He grabs the phone.
Depressing the payphone's hook, SOMEONE hangs up.
She allows a tiny smile.

With the phone's receiver cradled against her neck,
SOMEONE lets out a whisper.
She wipes away a tear then replaces the receiver.
At the FBI, Agent SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE takes his cell back and heads out of the room.
As he leaves, Agent SOMEONE bows his head.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE brushes a tear from her eye then slides on a pair of sunglasses.
Golden sunlight glows down on her as she turns away from the phone and dons a hat.
She strides toward a bus parked at the side of the road.
A woman sitting on a bench stares off with disinterested eyes as SOMEONE passes by then boards the bus.
Its door closes after her and the vehicle pulls into the road.
The bus trails billows of exhaust as it trundles into the distance.
The bare-chested soldier watches the students halt at the end of the SOMEONE. A live young woman with wavy, corn silk hair, sets her purse on the railing.
A boyish guy sits on the railings, sending her purse plunging into the water.
As SOMEONE jogs up the SOMEONE toward the beach, the soldier jumps off the railing and plummets 15 feet into the water. The blonde's jaw drops. Underwater, the soldier swims down along the SOMEONE's barnacled supports. The purse stirs in the current, on the SOMEONE strewn ocean floor. The soldier seizes it, then kicks off the bottom and shoots back to the surface.
The soldier swims toward the beach.
On the sand, SOMEONE kicks off his flip-flops, and trots into the water, meeting the soldier in the surf.
The soldier delivers it.
The smiling woman shakes her drenched bag.
SOMEONE ambles off.
SOMEONE halts and walks back toward them.
He grabs his surfboard.
As SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE, he accidentally bangs his board on the SOMEONE.
They head off side by side.
The setting sun casts long shadows over the sand.

As he demonstrates, she copies him.

A pickup slows beside him. It's SOMEONE. SOMEONE ride shotgun.
He stumbles.
SOMEONE loads his board into the bed of the truck. Later they drive.
SOMEONE points at SOMEONE with a nod.
SOMEONE sways capriciously and tickles the men's necks. Now the truck stops before a modest home with a bushy tree in the front yard. SOMEONE climbs out.
SOMEONE heads off.
He carries his board toward the house.
Now, SOMEONE opens the front door and enters a room veiled in shadow.
In a study, a balding man wearing a single white glove examines a coin under a magnifying glass. SOMEONE lifts the edge of a window shade covering the room's French door, and peeks inside at his father.
The oblivious man's gaze remains locked on his coin.
SOMEONE lets go of the shade and walks away.
His father glances over his shoulder, then stares off glumly.
SOMEONE heads into his room.
Outside, laundry whips on a line in the wind.
In the kitchen.
SOMEONE's father purses his lips into a thoughtful frown, and digs in his pocket. He pulls out a set of keys and hands them to SOMEONE, who ambles toward the door.
Later, a sign on a shabby seaside building reads, Bowens Island Restaurant.
Loitering men spot SOMEONE and swap looks. A goateed guy speaks up.
SOMEONE inches over to him.
SOMEONE joins a puzzled SOMEONE a few steps ahead of him.
Later in the restaurant.
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE blankly, and offers a fleeting grin.
She smiles back.
At twilight, two men fish on the dock outside the restaurant. Back inside.
She smiles quizzically.
He munches some food. Eyes the rosy-cheeked young woman, then shyly bows his head.
SOMEONE locks her in his sudden sobered gaze.
Later, they stroll toward his front door.
They head inside.
SOMEONE's father looks up from his desk.
He stands to greet them.

Now the SOMEONE family car pulls up in front of SOMEONE's house. Riding with SOMEONE, she beams.
SOMEONE chews his pursed lips. Leaning over, SOMEONE gives him a kiss on the cheek. Then gets out of the car.
SOMEONE grins at him and shuts the door. He happily gazes after her.
At the beach, SOMEONE paddles his surfboard out over the breaking waves. He crests one, then swims farther out.
Later, he paddles with a flow of a swelling wave, as its foaming crest reaches his board, he gets to his feet and surfs it until it breaks. Later, he sits straddling his board, gazing at the houses along the shore.
Later still, he paddles out past a stone jetty.
At her house, SOMEONE steps out on her screened-in porch, and gazes toward the beach.
Now she walks with SOMEONE, as he carries his board from the water.
They stroll toward her home.
Now they approach a partially constructed house.
Later, she leads him through the house's framework.
It starts to rain.
She leads him under a cluster of boards supported by a beam.
They stand close together.
She strokes his eyebrow.
Looking away, SOMEONE works his mouth.
SOMEONE shrugs.

She lifts her chin and her nose brushes against his.
Opening her mouth, she kisses him hungrily.
SOMEONE drapes her arms around his neck, as they passionately make out. He lifts her up, and she wraps her legs around him. As SOMEONE lowers himself to the floor, she straddles his lap.
Now, as they walk down a sidewalk, SOMEONE clasps SOMEONE's hand to his chest. At the sun dappled construction site, SOMEONE arrives to find him working at the top of a ladder.
She stops, watching him appreciatively.
He spots her, and they share a warm smile.
Now, SOMEONE holds his surfboard, tucked under his arm as they trod into the ocean. Later a wet-suit clad SOMEONE, crouches low on the board as she awkwardly rides a wave.
Tumbling into the shallow water, she grins. From the shore, her female friend pouts beside SOMEONE, who sullenly watches the couple. Trying another wave, SOMEONE manages to stand briefly as SOMEONE cheers her on.
Now, she hugs his arm as they walk hand in hand past a cafe. At the SOMEONE house, the young couple enjoys a meal with SOMEONE's father.
Later, silhouetted by a dusky sky, SOMEONE frolics on the beach, playfully evading SOMEONE's grasp.
He finally catches her in his arms. Lifts her and spins. At the construction site, the couple adds a plywood board to a wall. She swats her hand in front of him, as he hammers it in place.
In a living room, SOMEONE sings and plays guitar for SOMEONE.
In a hallway, SOMEONE sneaks up on her as she shuts a door. He turns her to face him, and they share a tender kiss.
SOMEONE peeks around a corner.
As his father paces in the living room, SOMEONE carries his girlfriend upstairs. Now they tumble unto his bed.
Mr. SOMEONE slows, blinking.
He gives a startled turn, then stares off. His brow knitted.
Upstairs SOMEONE rolls off the bed, then scrambles to a closet and shuts herself in.
She pulls at the door knobs, but he yanks the doors open.
Pouncing at her side, he tickles her.
As our view drifts upward, his armed uniform obscures them from view.
Back in the living room, SOMEONE smiles as she plays the guitar.
Reclining beside her, SOMEONE beams appreciatively.
Now, tall reeds wave in a breeze as the young man hikes into view, and gazes ahead. On the beach, a small group plays volleyball amidst a boisterous party. Near a grill, SOMEONE pats SOMEONE's shoulder.
Another group sits around two young men playing acoustic guitars.
SOMEONE hangs back, pensively taking in the cheerful scene.
Turning, he spots a solitary figure sitting alone at the base of a grassy dune.
At the volleyball net, SOMEONE pauses. He watches his rival cross to the dune, then turns back to his game.
SOMEONE hikes along a grassy ridge towards SOMEONE, and sneaks down behind her. He playfully grabs her side, startling the live young beauty.
She smiles contentedly in his arms.
SOMEONE lowers her troubled gaze.
Pulling her closer, SOMEONE kisses her brow.
He rocks her in his arms.
Her lips creep into a faint smile, and he kisses her brow again.

Glaring lividly, SOMEONE smacks his arm. SOMEONE faces her briefly, then leaves. SOMEONE cups a hand over his nose.

Daytime, SOMEONE stands on SOMEONE's porch, knocking on the screen door.
In the next yard, SOMEONE takes out the trash, sporting a black eye and a swollen nose.

Now an oven door opens, revealing two pans of lasagna.
A pair of hands and oven mitts take them out and sets them on a stove. SOMEONE wanders into the kitchen.
SOMEONE shuffles into the dining room. His father closes the oven door, crosses to an island counter and watches him. The young man clears one of three place settings from the dining room table. Taking it into the kitchen, he sets the plate, place mat and glass on the island. His father looks on as he starts to put the silverware away.
SOMEONE puts the silverware back down.
As he steps away, Mr. SOMEONE methodically sets the silverware aside.
He picks up the plate in both hands. Sets it at a precise angle in a wooden case, and slides a glass door close in front of it.
Later, we watch through a doorway, as father and son eat at the dining room table. SOMEONE gazes off as he chews, then looks down at his plate.
His father picks at his food.
SOMEONE watches him with a concerned expression.
With a melancholy stare, Mr. SOMEONE scoops a large fork full of lasagna into his mouth and chews.

Now at a bus station.
He takes two bags from his father.
The young man boards a waiting bus.
Its long side window shows Mr. SOMEONE lingering on the spot, staring off as he stuffs his hands into his pockets. The bus pulls away.
On the bus, SOMEONE reads SOMEONE's letter.
Now amongst sleeping soldiers, SOMEONE reads by flashlight.
Daytime at an airfield.
The soldiers file off a plane in their camouflaged uniforms. Each carrying a duffel.
SOMEONE exits the aircraft, squinting in the sun and proceeds across the tarmac.
He eyes one of his peers.
The dark-haired soldier stares defeatedly.
Their mustached superior leaves. SOMEONE lowers his gaze. At dusk, the platoon crosses the airfield and climbs the boarding steps of a cargo plane. On board, SOMEONE writes a letter.
Now a helicopter descends. SOMEONE rides on board among the others.
He gazes at passing trees.
The soldiers hop out of the landed chopper, one by one. Now they enter a crude village where a calf drinks from ruts of sitting water.
He hands a letter to a pilot.
SOMEONE watches the helicopter take off.
Now multiple letters travel along four conveyor belts. One of them addressed to SOMEONE Curtis. Letters flip vertically through a machine. A bin of bundled letters slides down a track, and a postal worker sorts the letters into cubbies. On a college campus, a mailman takes a few letters from his satchel and places them into one of many PO boxes. From inside the PO box, we see SOMEONE take out her mail.

Then takes out a coin, which he holds under a magnifying glass.
Flipping the nickel over, he reveals the back of a penny.
He glances around the desk, and finds another coin. SOMEONE smiles.
Riding in the bed of a transport truck, SOMEONE reads "What's the story?".
He stares off.
In a flashback, a boy receives a handful of change from an ice-cream vendor.
Leaving the van, the boy studies his change.
Young SOMEONE licks his ice-cream cone.

Mr. SOMEONE collects the coin and tugs his son away.
Mr. SOMEONE hurries down a sidewalk and briefly stops for SOMEONE to catch up.
In another store.

His dad glances over his shoulder.
On campus, a passing student bumps into SOMEONE as she reads. At the bottom of a staircase, she reaches a walkway where frantic peers gather and talk on cellphones. A confused SOMEONE holds SOMEONE's letter with both hands as she observes the anxious activity.
As SOMEONE remains frozen, our view is sent to take in a bird's eye view of the chaos. Now wearing plain clothes, SOMEONE walks alone on a busy street in an eastern European town. A horse-drawn cart, a woman on a bicycle, and a man on a scooter crosses path. SOMEONE approaches a cafe, where pedestrians gather outside. Reaching the entrance, SOMEONE joins his dark-haired buddy to watch television news coverage. Black smoke billows from one of New York City's Twin Towers.
SOMEONE breathes heavily as he watches SOMEONE falling off the building.
Fade to black.
Now in a hanger, the soldier’s superior approaches.
SOMEONE packs.
SOMEONE's friend rises.
SOMEONE, the only one left seated, lowers his gaze.
Later in a conference room, he shakes hands with two soldiers then grabs his bag.

Inside a crowded airport, SOMEONE sees SOMEONE on the other side of a security gate.
She ducks under a dividing rope, and hurries around to the other side. SOMEONE notices her and beams. She runs to him and leaps into his arms.
As he spins her around, they kiss.
A heavy-set traveler eyes them as he takes off his belt.

SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE. Mr. SOMEONE squeezes his brow.
Grimacing, he grabs at the door. SOMEONE reaches back. The car stops and Mr. SOMEONE gets out. A disheartened SOMEONE remains in the passenger seat, and rests his elbow on the window sill.
Mr. SOMEONE slouches at the side of the road.
She touches his back, and he walks off.
He walks a few paces away, then halts and hunches forward, catching his breath.

Now SOMEONE's car pulls onto a private road.
A stylish brunette woman in a white dress, crosses the front porch of a colonial plantation home, and greets arriving guests as she passes.

She flinches and shifts away from him.
SOMEONE bows his head and faces her from the side.
She looks at him ascant, then faces him fully.
She grimaces, agonizing and SOMEONE lowers his gaze.
She storms past him and disappears down the front steps, leaving him alone on the porch. SOMEONE watches her go, then swallows hard and hangs his head.
Now as guests stroll around the Curtis' expansive grounds, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE siting alone on a bench overlooking a marsh. His pace slows as he draws closer.
He gazes out at the wetlands as he waits a few feet away.
SOMEONE clasps SOMEONE's head in her hands, then wraps her arms around his neck and pulls him into a tight embrace. She rests her chin on his shoulder as he holds her.
She meets his gaze, then draws his face closer and kisses his forehead.
Leading him by the hand, SOMEONE takes SOMEONE to her family's stables. Inside, she leans back against a wall as she unbuttons his dress shirt.
He caresses her hair, then lovingly kisses her.
Dim blue light outlines SOMEONE's corn silk hair.
SOMEONE nuzzles the top of her head, as he sweeps her long blonde locks behind her back.
She parts his shirt, and slips it off his shoulders. Then wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him hungrily.
As SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE's neck, she lowers her dress and presses her body against his.
Now, SOMEONE's toned upper body hovers above SOMEONE.
Propped up by his arms, as she pulls his undershirt over his head.

He lies beside her, his arm reaching across her body, to stroke her corn silk tresses with his fingertips.
They kiss sweetly.
She stares distantly. Her hand clasping SOMEONE's smooth freckled shoulder.
With a wistful look, she closes her eyes.
A tear slides out.
Glistening in the light.
And rests at the corner of her eye.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold hands as they stroll outside the stable into the daylight.
SOMEONE carries her heels, and she wears his jacket over her dress.
A wider view shows warm sunlight glinting through Spanish moss on a tree, as the couple embraces in front of the stables.

As the captain heads off, our bird's eye view of his men swings down to watch them collect their belongings.
Now, an image of SOMEONE's address handwritten on an envelope, drifts into view.
In Afghanistan, SOMEONE patrols a bustling street.
He pauses to talk to a young boy.
In a close-up of SOMEONE's letter, we glimpse fragments of sentences.
Just not the same without you. Rises and sets for both of us, is what helps me survive day to day. Love SOMEONE.
In a college classroom SOMEONE writes thoughtfully.
A close-up shows her pen gracefully filling a page with elegant cursive.
Back in Afghanistan, a pallet drops from a plane, and a parachute opens above it.

Dust churns from their wheels. A Humvee passes a man leading a camel and maneuvers unto a busier road.
SOMEONE rides inside.
A man runs in front of their Humvee with his arms raised over his head.
The Humvee stops, and the soldiers climb out with their guns drawn.
SOMEONE heads away.
SOMEONE's dark-haired friend joins him. With their guns at the ready, they creep around the parameter of a decrepit factory.
The captain gestures to the rest of the team. Meanwhile, SOMEONE and Noodles round the corner of a deteriorating cement wall. Noodles glances at SOMEONE.

Now pale light shines through Venetian blinds, as SOMEONE lies in a bed.
A hand adjusts the slats on the blinds and bright sunlight pours into the room.
SOMEONE's head shifts, and his hazy vision finds a nurse at his bedside.
She smiles down at the groggy soldier.
As helooks at the nurse's kind expression, SOMEONE's vision gets blurrier, and he closes his eyes.
Fade to black.
Now, SOMEONE sits on the side of his bed, with his arm in a sling. Struggling, he manages to lift the strap over his head. He drops the sling on the floor.
Eyeing his reflection in a mirror, he unsnaps the top of his hospital gown, to reveal his bandaged shoulder.
He winces as he tears the tape and gauze from his skin.
As SOMEONE slips one arm into a t-shirt, sunlight gleams on the scarred flesh of two bullet wounds on his back.

Dirty dishes, bottles, and jars clutter the counter top and stove.
SOMEONE's haunted stare holds steady on the mess.
He treads down a hall to his father's shadowy study, and lingers in the doorway.
Now, he pulls open a drawer and finds a jumble of dozens of coins in small boxes.
He takes out a blue velvet box and opens it.
With a sober stare, he turns over the Jefferson Mule in his fingers.
Seated at his father's desk.
He lifts his head and gazes out a window.
SOMEONE sets the coin aside, and takes out a blank sheet of paper.

The ailing man wears an oxygen mask. An IV bag hangs above his head.
A doctor reading a file, continues on her way.
Mr. SOMEONE gives a weary blink.
SOMEONE stares at him uncomfortably.
He takes an envelope from his back pocket.
Glides his finger along its edge, then reluctantly hands it to his father.
Mr. SOMEONE lifts the flap.
With palsied hands, Mr. SOMEONE closes the envelope’s flap, and tucks the letter against the side of his body.

SOMEONE gently collapses unto the man's chest. And the coin collector cradles him as best he can.
Now, as misty rain pours down on an otherwise empty beach.
SOMEONE sits beside his surfboard with his knees pulled up, and his head bowed.
Later, lying belly down on his surfboard, he paddles out in the steel gray sea.
Cloudy rain sheets down, as the waves buck and toss beneath him.
He swings his legs into the water, and drops his unhooked ankle leash onto his board.
Releasing his grip on the board.
He lets himself drift away from it.

SOMEONE meets her gaze and she rubs the back of his head.
She smiles then kisses his brow.
They drive away. Our view lurches backward in brief irregular bursts of fast motion as we watch a pair of black SUVs pull out and follow them.
Now SOMEONE perches in a crumbling pane-less window high above the ground.
He sips from his flask as lightning flashes in the stormy sky. In the converted garage, SOMEONE sits hunched at a cluttered table.
He clenches SOMEONE's photo in his trembling hands.
Now lightning flashes in the sky as SOMEONE drives. SOMEONE sleeps in the passenger seat. She changes the radio station and turns her tender gaze to SOMEONE. Reaching out, she strokes his cheek with her finger then ruffles his hair.
Three SUVs come up behind them.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE overturns a cart. SOMEONE wakes.
On the road, the lead SUV rear ends the silver hatchback. In the garage, SOMEONE lurches. The hatchback swerves and the SUV pulls up to side swipe it. SOMEONE topples a shelving unit.
The SUV runs the hatchback off the road and down a rugged slope. SOMEONE staggers across the floor. The SUV rams the hatchback against a wall. SOMEONE's back arches, his eyes two dark hollow pits. In his perch, SOMEONE puts a cigarette in his lips and strikes a match. The flame blazes at a horizontal angle.
SOMEONE turns then throws the match down. Now he runs towards SOMEONE's garage to find a blazing light moving within. As he approaches the side of the building, a flaming blast erupts from its door. SOMEONE staggers back, shielding his eyes. Recovering, he finds a trail of fire stretching along the ground to a point of light speeding up the road.
In a deserted lot, the SUVs surround the hatchback.
SOMEONE gets out in a glare of headlights, gun in hand. Shielding her face, she shoots blindly.
A male figure lunges out and beats her.

SOMEONE crouches beside SOMEONE.
SOMEONE's head droops forward defeatedly.
SOMEONE stands, aims his revolver at her and cocks the hammer.
Nearby a goateed thug turns. SOMEONE looks up. Following their gaze, SOMEONE discovers a fiery blast erupting on a far wall.
From it, Ghost Rider's flaming motorcycle arcs through the air. It lands in the middle of the lot, filling our view as it spins to a halt. The heavyset thug staggers back fearfully. The others stand motionless, staring at the Rider's flaming skull.
A heavy black boot with burn marks steps off the footrest and grinds into the gravel.
The rider swings himself off of the monstrous vehicle. Flames glow within its engine and exhaust vents.
The rider's gloved fingers close around his heavy duty chain. Lightening casts a glow on the mustached thug as he holds his shotgun ready. The chain links glow and the rider turns his scorched flaming skull.
Staring, SOMEONE rolls unsteadily in the gravel. The rider's head cocks erratically. He raises his fist to his opposite shoulder, then lifts his other hand and at angle. SOMEONE's slack jawed gaze shifts of the otherworldly creature to his henchmen.
The goateed thug shoots, his bullets making glowing holes in the rider's scorched leather jacket. Turning, the creature slings his chain back, grazing SOMEONE's shoulder. He flings it around the thug and gives it a yank, incinerating him in a flash. Lowering his chain, the rider sways side to side, his head tilting to and fro. A smudge of smoking embers stands in place of the goateed henchman. The mustached thug eyes them fearfully, then faces the swaying demonic creature. The rider wheels around to face him. In a rapid series of erratic movements, the rider charges. He stops inches from the mustached thug and looms over him.
The rider lowers his bony jaw, his mouth a swirl of flames. He leans over his victim who trembles and sputters incoherently. Looking along, the heavyset thug drops his rifle and sinks to his knees. The riders jaws abruptly snap shut.
Staring, SOMEONE grabs his brutish henchmen's shoulder.
Ghost Rider grabs the mustached thug's face. The henchman's wide eyes reflect his ghastly flaming visage as the rider cocks his head appraisingly then leans in to peer more closely at the man. Nearby, a scratch on SOMEONE's cheek seeps blood. SOMEONE opens the rear hatch of his SUV, pulls out an enormous rifle and hands it off to his brutish henchman.
The mustached thug's features twist in a helpless sob. The rider keeps his head in a firm grip, staring relentlessly. Our vision doubles as the thug's eyes cross and he sinks down. Nearby, SOMEONE stirs. A drop of his blood falls from his cheek and hits a stone. The mustached thug incinerates and the rider turns. SOMEONE's eyes snap open.
The rider clasps his own hand and massages his palm. SOMEONE's eyes shift upward and his head rolls to follow them. Facing him, the rider breaks into a march. A thug steps in and shoots but the demonic creature incinerates him with shot. Beside SOMEONE, the heavyset thug scrambles back. The boy regards the rider calmly as it arrives before him.
Lying in the dirt, SOMEONE reaches out desperately.
SOMEONE and his brutish henchmen run out beside her, each armed with an enormous rifle. They both fire. The shots send the rider flying. He hits the side of an SUV, caving it in.
SOMEONE fires a grenade. It explodes on impact, destroying the SUV.
He joins SOMEONE and the heavyset thug.
The heavyset thug forces SOMEONE into the back of another SUV while SOMEONE gets in the front. As it pulls away, SOMEONE reaches out for it then slumps breathlessly.
Cut to black.
Now we gaze down on SOMEONE as he lies in a hospital bed. His brow knits painfully and he stirs awake.
SOMEONE looks around, notices an IV in his hand and lifts up his hospital gown.
Jagged pink scars mar his flesh. A pretty young nurse steps in through a ring of curtain.
He flops back on his pillow.
Eyeing him uneasily, the nurse leaves. SOMEONE notices his jacket draped over a chair near a cabinet of drugs and medical supplies. Now he opens the cabinet and rummages through the drugs. He takes two handfuls of pill bottles. Now fully dressed, he slips out of his room and hurries down the hall.
Ahead, two doctors try to stop SOMEONE from leaving.
He pauses, watching her. Leaving the doctors, she halts at the sight of him.
SOMEONE's eyes look her over then narrow his eyes.
With an uneasy gaze, she steps away.
SOMEONE clutches her wounded shoulder as she heads up a ramp.
SOMEONE stares after her, glances back over his shoulder and follows.
Now in a sunlit clearing, SOMEONE's SUV sits parked with the driver's door open.
The heavyset thug stands nearby as SOMEONE opens SOMEONE's door and yanks him out.
The boy lands on all fours in the dirt. SOMEONE steps away.
Now at a busy transit platform, a figure in a black suit, matching coat, and well-shined shoes steps off a train.
Carrying a briefcase, he pulls out a sleek cellphone, slides it open and answers it.
His back to us, the man stops at a newsstand.
The man turns, revealing a long pale face with aging features.
SOMEONE thrusts his cell at SOMEONE's ear.
The screen splits down the middle. On the left, we watch the mysterious man's moving lips.
On the right, the phone at SOMEONE's ear.
The boy slumps on his knees, his hand limp in his lap. His shoulders heave.
Leaning back, his jaw distends in a supernatural roar.
SOMEONE drops the phone and staggers back. SOMEONE collapses on the dirt.
SOMEONE picks up his phone and puts it to his ear.
The well-dressed man ends the call.
SOMEONE lowers the phone.
From above, we drift down toward the boy as a wind blows a drift of sand over the ground. Nearby, SOMEONE angrily kicks the SUV's door shut. SOMEONE lies motionless, his brow knitted as his breath comes in shallow gasps. Light fills our view.
At the hospital, SOMEONE's head lurches back.
Blinking confusedly, he gives it a shake.
Stepping outside, he pauses and massages his right palm.
SOMEONE looks around and glimpses SOMEONE hurrying alongside the building. He staggers down the steps, clutching his abdomen. Peeking around the corner, he finds SOMEONE moving through a parking lot with affected nonchalance. She pauses by a car, checking its doors. They don't budge. Moving on to the car beside it, she turns. SOMEONE darts back behind the wall.
SOMEONE moves on then pauses warily.
She jogs out of view.
SOMEONE staggers after her.
Stepping past an ambulance, he looks around. SOMEONE lunges, aiming a gun at him.
SOMEONE adjusts her stance and narrows her eyes.
Grabbing her wrist, he brings the gun to his head.
SOMEONE wrenches herself from his grasp. SOMEONE lowers his regretful gaze. The mother regards him disgustedly but makes no move to leave him.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
SOMEONE sighs tearfully.
He offers a kind nod. SOMEONE's gaze hardens and she swallows. SOMEONE tilts his head.
Now SOMEONE's motorcycle sits on a truck's flatbed.
He knocks back some pills.
At the wheel, SOMEONE faces him.
A flashback.
Light overwhelms our view. Back in the present.
The truck takes an exit. Now in stylized animation, we view SOMEONE and other satanic incarnations.
SOMEONE Springer ends the series.
A man on fire shakes hands with a human.
We focus on the clasped hands. Now in SOMEONE's SUV, SOMEONE sits with his eyes closed.
His eyes open and he turns.
SOMEONE shifts his indignant gaze.
Turning away, SOMEONE flops back against his seat.
His gaze calm, SOMEONE lunges forward between the seats and wrenches the steering wheel. SOMEONE swipes at the boy as the SUV swerves wildly then fishtails. SOMEONE fastens his seat belt then gives his abductor a smirk. The SUV hits a concrete barrier and flips over on its roof. Steam wafts from the upturned undercarriage. Inside, SOMEONE hangs upside down, his eyes half closed in a placid gaze.
He blinks and looks around.
His hand finds his seat belt buckle and pushes the release button.
SOMEONE tumbles down and wrestles his way past the heavyset thug.
As he crawls from the wrecked SUV, the thug grabs his ankle.
SOMEONE tugs himself free and runs away.
We spy flames spreading over the undercarriage as SOMEONE and his brutish henchman escape, leaving the heavyset thug stuck in his crushed doorway.
SOMEONE shakes loose of his grasp and follows SOMEONE.
SOMEONE runs under a bridge along a river.
SOMEONE and his henchman follow. A massive fireball erupts from the bridge as the SUV explodes. SOMEONE and SOMEONE both stare then continue the chase. The henchman leaps from a concrete barrier to the riverbank. SOMEONE jumps from a ridge. As he lands on slippery rocks, his ankle snaps.
SOMEONE arrives and hauls him up by his jacket.
Two campers look on.
He points at the mohawked camper's brightly painted van.
The henchman fixes a menacing glare on the camper.
Their carefree smiles fade as they notice his large gun.
Now SOMEONE rides shotgun and his henchman drives the hippy-dippy vehicle. He looks over his shoulder at SOMEONE who sits slumped and blindfolded on the floor. Covered in swirling day-glo patterns, the van sputters fumes as it travels up the road.
Now the flatbed truck speeds down a dark stretch of road. Inside, SOMEONE's closed eyes flutter. We glimpse Ghost Rider's skull.
SOMEONE wakes with a jolt. He massages his palm and eyes SOMEONE.
Now two bodyguards flank a man in a tacky suit as he heads up a winding stone stairway. Camera flashes erupt around him as he ends a call on his cellphone. He heads up another flight of stone steps to a crowded warehouse floor where two men face off on a round platform.
Chewing gum, SOMEONE twitches.
Below, a fighter faces a hog on a leash. In a back room, the tacky man addresses thugs counting cash.
"Count every dollar. I don't want these idiots robbing me. Everyone's robbing me. It makes my balls hurt."
Now as SOMEONE's associate lights a cigarette, SOMEONE approaches. Subtitles: "Hello, Vasil."
SOMEONE shoves him against a wall and SOMEONE holds up a knife.
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE's phone.
Cringing, SOMEONE shakes his head.
Part of his face becomes skeletal then morphs back.
SOMEONE shoves the cellphone in SOMEONE's mouth.
His eye transforms into an empty black socket.
He shakes his head and the socket reverts to human form.
SOMEONE grits his teeth in pain then eyes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE nods.
He slams SOMEONE against the wall.
Two thugs appear and SOMEONE hurls SOMEONE into them.
SOMEONE begins to change as he races through the warehouse's abandoned rooms. A thug charges and he shoves the man away, setting him on fire. With flames now dancing on his arms, SOMEONE rushes outside. He sees his motorcycle surrounded in billowing fire, waiting for him at the end of an alley. Now he rides alternately cringing and grinning crazily as his face morphs from his human form to the Ghost Rider and back again.
His nose and eyes take skull form and he blows fire from his nostrils. Cringing, he reverts to a human face. He struggles to remain composed. Half of his face morphs again. Flames lick his cheek and burst from his eye socket.
His motorcycle's billowing fire rises and engulfs him. Now in the quarry, our view sweeps down a hulking bucket chain excavator's giant cutting wheel. A caravan of SUVs drives under the machine's long truss boom followed by a pair of cargo trucks. As the last truck passes under, a man climbs a ladder to the excavator's control cab which sits just behind the cutting wheel. At the boom's opposite end, armed guards keep watch on a balcony on the excavator's base structure. The trucks pull into an area surrounded by towering stacks of shipping containers. A bearded man exits an SUV and his men carry out two military crates.
He hands one of his men the missile shoulder launcher.
He ignites a lighter.
He blows out its flame.
The bearded supplier turns to his guards.
He smiles disbelievingly at SOMEONE, now in a storage room.
He sits wearing a blindfold.
She pulls it off.
She cuts the restraints tying him to a support beam then helps him up.
As she supports him, the brutish henchman appears. She flips open her knife but he twists her around and dips her as if for a kiss then hurls her to the floor. He extended his gun's telescopic handle. SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a fearful glance.
All three of them lift their eyes skyward.
Outside, SOMEONE glances around. The brutish henchman frowns.
SOMEONE throws her knife at him but he catches it. As he turns to her with a smile, she shoots him.
Outside, SOMEONE smirks.
He beckons the bearded supplier who hurries over with the missile launcher. They move to the edge of the quarry.
A man hands the launching tube to SOMEONE. Lifting it onto his shoulder, the wavy haired criminal peers through its thermal sight and finds Ghost Rider's glowing image as he speeds along the cliff above the quarry. He fires and the missile arcs high into the air.
As Ghost Rider speeds down into the quarry, the missile dives at him and explodes.
A mushroom cloud of flames billows into the air.
The bearded supplier's grin fades. Following his gaze, SOMEONE finds Ghost Rider unharmed, standing at the explosion's outskirts.
He backs away.
As Ghost Rider advances on a line of guards, they fire their assault rifles. He whips his chain at three of them and they disintegrate into flames and ash. He whirls the chain above his head, then strikes another. Dropping his gun, a guard races away. Ghost Rider whips him in half. As another guard pulls the pin on a grenade, Ghost Rider whips him and the grenade drops. Ghost Rider stares at it.
The guards turn from the explosion's blinding light. As it fades, they see Ghost Rider's horizontal body rotating three feet above the ground. The men aim their guns. Ghost Rider looks at one who flinches. Now on his feet, Ghost Rider faces him.
The guard shoots into Ghost Rider's open mouth. The flaming skeleton waits as bullets fly in. The man lowers his gun and Ghost Rider's head slumps. He bellows a stream of flaming bullets at the guard.
SOMEONE shoulders the reloaded launcher.
Through its sight, he sees Ghost Rider approaching. As the flaming skeleton knocks him onto his back.
SOMEONE fires the launcher aimed right at him.
The missile drives him high into the sky. In midair, the missile extinguishes Ghost Rider's flames, then propels him to the ground.
A brilliant fire cloud billows high into the sky. Ghost Rider's smoldering hand reaches out of the fiery crater left behind.
Ghost Rider's gaze shifts from the excavator's giant wheel to the control cab on the boom. As guards shoot at him, the leather clad skeleton rises to his feet.
His skull charred and smoking. As shots pierce his chest, the bullet holes glow. He starts to climb the ladder to the control cab, then pauses and turns to SOMEONE who gawks. He resumes climbing while a mass of guards unleashes a barrage of bullets. Now inside the cab, Ghost Rider shoots flames from his skull, shattering the cab's windows.
Fire billows down the excavator's boom and bursts around its giant wheel.
Sitting in the control seat between two levers, he pulls one back and pushes the other forward.
The flaming boom swivels around.
Shifting the levers, he raises the wheel high into the air, then smashes it onto a watchtower. He lifts the flaming wheel again, then heaves both levers forward with a maniacal grin.
The wheel crashes down on a trailer. From a balcony, SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch with wide eyes as the wheel slams a truck and some shipping containers then grabs them with the toothy ridges along its perimeter. The spinning wheel catapults a piece of flaming metal into the sky.
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE away.
The bearded supplier readies a launcher then spots the wheel above him.
Ghost Rider shifts the levers and the wheel crashes down.
It crushes the supplier in a burst of flames which sends SOMEONE flying back. The wavy haired man stands, blood dripping from his mouth.
SOMEONE helps SOMEONE down a flight of stairs. SOMEONE draws a gun. As he aims it at them, Ghost Rider's chain wraps around his ankle. It yanks him off his feet then drags him to the flaming skeleton. Ghost Rider lifts him off the ground.
SOMEONE drives off with SOMEONE in the flatbed truck.
As SOMEONE struggles in Ghost Rider's grip, the flaming skeleton hurls him away then gazes into the distance. He heads off. In the truck, SOMEONE gives an alarmed look.
SOMEONE shoots him a fearful glance. In the rearview mirror, she sees Ghost Rider closing in on his motorcycle.
She looks over her shoulder at him but finds no one. As she turns back, she sees him beside her. He grabs her.
Pulling her out through the driver's side window, he dismounts his motorcycle and grips her by the arms. Nearby, the truck rolls to a stop. SOMEONE's feet dangle a few inches from the ground.
SOMEONE climbs out of the truck.
SOMEONE's eyes widen as the rider gazes into them.
He looks back at SOMEONE.
Under the boy's steady stare, he releases SOMEONE. As he heads toward SOMEONE, his flames briefly fade.
He stumbles back a few steps, then continues toward SOMEONE who holds his ground. The fire dancing around his skull dims in a billow of smoke and Ghost Rider staggers, swatting at it. He shakes himself out of the daze. With his gaze fixed on the boy, he trudges closer, stopping a few feet away as inky smoke swirls around him. SOMEONE watches the smoke ringed skeleton drop to one knee.
The flames on his skull subside and he holds his hands in front of his face as if to protect it. The smoke dissipates, leaving SOMEONE in a kneeling position. He glances around.
He lifts his gaze to a boy.
At a truck stop diner, SOMEONE sits alone at a booth with a frown, his eyes fixed on a nearby family.
He sees the father ruffle his son's hair.
Approaching from behind with a tray of food, SOMEONE stops and follows SOMEONE's gaze. He watches the father affectionately touch his son's head then glances back at SOMEONE.
Sitting across from him, he slides the tray over.
He glances at the family then reaches out and touches SOMEONE's hair. The boy recoils.
SOMEONE stares sullenly.
Tilting his head, SOMEONE scrutinizes him.
SOMEONE gives an impassive look.
SOMEONE quirks a smile. SOMEONE joins them.
Sitting beside SOMEONE, she wraps an arm around him and kisses his head.
She gives a critical look as she sees SOMEONE lift a water pitcher and drink from it.
He chugs obliviously.
He flashes a grin at them then resumes drinking.
He drinks some more and SOMEONE nods. SOMEONE glances at her.
He clears the inside of his cheek with his tongue, then takes another drink.
Now at the quarry, emergency workers tend to the destruction. SOMEONE lies unconscious under a cement slab. SOMEONE approaches.
Subtitles appear as he speaks.
His expression becomes flat and he stares out lifelessly.
Lowering himself to his knees, SOMEONE slides his hand between SOMEONE and the cement slab. He presses SOMEONE's chest and the dead man's eyes open.
His lips stutter.
The left side of SOMEONE's face becomes withered and wrinkled,
and blood vessels burst in his eye.
Splotches of sores appear on his skin.
SOMEONE's body trembles as his dark hair morphs to blonde.
He withdraws under the cement slab.
Grabbing the slab, SOMEONE lifts it.
He tosses it aside to expose SOMEONE who now has straight shoulder-length platinum hair and ashen skin.
The resurrected man scrambles on his hands and knees in the dirt then glances around. He rises to his feet and eyes his gloved hands.
SOMEONE tosses him a smoldering piece of wood.
It rots in SOMEONE's hand.
He stares at SOMEONE with a pleased gaze.
Glancing over his shoulder, SOMEONE sees an EMT standing at an ambulances open side door.
SOMEONE follows his lackey's gaze. As they stare, the EMT furrows his brow and takes a step back.
He shifts his perplexed eyes. As he turns around, darkness engulfs him. SOMEONE grabs his head.
He presses a hand to the man's face which becomes dark with rotting flesh.
Smiling, SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE's touch decays the EMT's body until it crumbles apart.
SOMEONE gazes steadily at his lackey.
Later, SOMEONE works on his bike as he and SOMEONE ride on the truck's flatbad.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
He jumps up to his feet.
As SOMEONE mimes urinating, SOMEONE imagines Ghost Rider shooting out a powerful stream of fire.
He pictures the skeleton nodding at him.
SOMEONE glances at the passing landscape, his face becoming somber. SOMEONE sits beside him.
He eyes the boy.
SOMEONE meets his gaze with a grave look.
He bows his head.
Riding a motorbike, SOMEONE catches up to them.
He pulls up to the driver's side window.
Grinning, he speeds ahead of the truck.
SOMEONE mimes firing her gun with her fingers.
Now the rear wheel of SOMEONE's motorcycle burns rubber as it races past the tow truck, trailing a billow of smoke.
It pulls up beside then passes SOMEONE who shakes his head at SOMEONE. The boy sits in front of SOMEONE on the gas tank with his legs draped over the handlebars.
SOMEONE sets a bent knee at the rear of his seat then straightens it, pushing his weight onto his back foot.
Popping a wheelie, they glide along on only the bike's rear wheel.
Watching from the truck, SOMEONE smiles. SOMEONE shifts his motorcycle onto only its front wheel.
As the bike comes to a full stop, its rear wheels stay up in the air for a moment then drops back to the ground.
The tow truck cruises past. Now SOMEONE's motorcycle catches up to SOMEONE again. Meanwhile, the hijacked ambulance glides down an otherwise vacant road through desert landscape.
Driving it, SOMEONE reaches into a lunch box on the seat beside him.
He pulls out a sandwich. It grows moldy and disintegrates at his gloved touch. Glancing into the lunch box, he takes out an apple and watches the bright green fruit turn grey and crumble.
He rubs his gloved fingers against each other cleaning the dust from them.
He finds a plastic wrapped Twinkie and examines it then gives it a squeeze.
The top of the wrapper pops open and the end of the spongy cream-filled yellow cake peeps out.
SOMEONE bites into the still fresh snack and chews thoughtfully.
He shoves half of the remaining sheathed Twinkie into his mouth, then bites down on the wrapper using his teeth to hold the cake in place. He slides the wrapper out. It's now empty plastic smeared with cream.
Later, in the desert, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE along a path between jutting cliffs and barren mountains with cave-like openings.
They approach towering rock formations that appear constructed into, creating buildings within their natural structures.
SOMEONE gazes around.
He sees some robed monks.
A group of monks greets them.
The one in front removes his hood revealing tattooed writing covering his face and bald scalp. He places a hand on SOMEONE's head.
SOMEONE's fingers caress the cross hanging around his neck.
The monk glances at SOMEONE who gives an awkward nod.
They embrace then switch sides and embrace again. SOMEONE notices more monks surrounding their group.
The tattoo faced monk shifts his intense gaze to SOMEONE who lifts his chin.
The monk twitches a tight smile.
SOMEONE turns to his companion.
He winks at SOMEONE.
He moves to SOMEONE's side.
SOMEONE gives an uncertain look as she and SOMEONE start off with the monks.
A monk reaches for him.
SOMEONE kneels in front of him.
He touches SOMEONE's cheek.
SOMEONE guides her dejected son away.
SOMEONE glances aside.
Now they walk through a vast wine cellar.
SOMEONE grabs a bottle from a table in the middle of a rotunda.
He takes a swig.
He looks heavenward.
Our view ascends to find an angel spreading its wings over the earth.
The angel's eyes bulge, glimpsing a barrage of images - war, money, riots, napalm, a seductive woman.
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE and grins. He leaves a wall of cubby holes stocked with wine.
Fire engulfs a winged skeleton.
SOMEONE lowers his troubled gaze.
SOMEONE grins then wraps his arm around his friend.
At a cubby hole, he takes out an ancient bottle of ruddy wine.
He kisses the bottle then looks at SOMEONE.
He walks off and SOMEONE gazes thoughtfully.
He puts the cross around his neck in SOMEONE's hand and looks him in the eyes.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze. SOMEONE grabs the possessed man's shoulder and they sit down.
Holding the cross, SOMEONE looks into the priests eyes.
Daylight shines down on them from a hole in the ceiling.
He wipes a tear from his eye.
SOMEONE turns to his bag and takes out a small loaf of bread.
He breaks it in half.
He puts one half back.
He breaks off a piece for SOMEONE.
SOMEONE takes it from him.
He takes a bite then shifts his gaze.
SOMEONE pats him on the shoulder.
Now SOMEONE wanders through a tunnel.
He reaches the end of the passage and a huge slab blocks him from turning back. He enters an empty room.
Our view whirls, glimpsing numerous passageways. SOMEONE looks up at the room's domed ceiling.
A brilliant light flashes then shines down on him. He collapses to his knees.
He rolls on his back, his eyes morphing into hollow sockets.
As he convulses, the image distorts.
As he grimaces, his memories move in reverse. His blood lifts from the contract and the broken bottle reforms.
As SOMEONE arched his back in pain, we see him as a flameless Ghost Rider falling through a white void.
He drops into the distance, his arms and legs flailing.
He shoots a seemingly endless length of chain from his mouth. As it pulls taut, it breaks from his skull with a fiery flash.
His skull emits a flow of smoke, distorting his bone structure.
Cut to black.
Now on the floor of the empty room, SOMEONE lies flat on his back with his eyes closed.
Our view draws near the side of his face.
He wakes with a start and rises to a crouch then looks at his gloved right hand, gives it a rub, and brightens.
He hurries through one of the passages.
He runs down another.
He reaches the mouth of a cavern.
He heads down a stairway carved into the stone.
The path leads him to bluff overlooking the region.
He shifts his gaze.
SOMEONE hurries off. He enters a vaulted hall.
He finds the monks detaining SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE.
A monk seizes his arm.
SOMEONE falls to his knees, his gloved hand trembling.
SOMEONE swipes at another monk with his free hand but the monk grabs his throat.
The tattoo faced monk addresses SOMEONE.
He runs the backs of his fingers down her cheek then jams his thumb just below her chin, knocking her unconscious. SOMEONE looks on.
"Take them away until the thing is done."
The monks drag SOMEONE and SOMEONE out.
The tattoo faced monk marches off.
Outside, the hooded monks stand in a circle.
Two more bring SOMEONE to the center and bend him over a rock.
The tattooed monk follows. A monk pulls back the nervous boy's collar. The others sway side to side.
The tattoo faced monk draws a sword and taps its long curved blade to the back of SOMEONE's neck.
With both hands, the executioner raises the sword overhead.
He finds himself surrounded by darkness, then twirls his sword defensively.
As another monk gropes in the dark, SOMEONE grabs him from behind, rip him and lets him fall.
He runs to another and throws him down.
The tattoo faced monk spots SOMEONE leaping from his victim. SOMEONE snaps a decaying monk's neck. He grabs another from behind. The tattoo faced monk swings his sword. SOMEONE catches his wrist then vanishes. As the tattoo faced monk looks for him, SOMEONE grabs the swords hilt, causing its blade to rust and crumble. The monk grabs SOMEONE's throat and he collapses to his knees, waving his hands in surrender.
The monk lets go, his hand decomposing.
SOMEONE smashes the monk's hand, grabs his jaw, then slams him onto his back. Sneering at his victim, he holds two fingers over the monk's tattooed face. The monk's bald head withers, his skin crumpling. As he rots completely, SOMEONE holds up his two fingers.
In the light of day, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE jump back from his kill. He glances at the surrounding bodies of the other monks, each petrified in frightful poses. The boy steps back nervously.
SOMEONE eyes him, stroking his platinum hair.
Now as we rove over the craggy landscape, glaring sunlight overtakes our view.
Then shrinks to a pinpoint as we drift among two petrified monks left permanently kneeling in prayer.
As a butterfly lands on a sprouting mushroom, the image focuses on a moss ridden monk.
Crouching over one of the dead, SOMEONE picks up his cross necklace. She looks at SOMEONE.
SOMEONE joins them.
He heads off.
SOMEONE shifts her worried gaze. SOMEONE nods for her to follow.
Now we soar over the ruins of the demolished structure overgrown with weeds. Uzak gokten, Turkey.
An ambulance pulls up to the archways of an ancient amphitheater's outer wall.
Black clad guards surround the building.
SOMEONE walks out followed by two of his masked men.
SOMEONE steps out of the ambulance and shuts the driver's door.
SOMEONE opens the ambulance's back door.
He pulls out SOMEONE, bound to a stretcher.
SOMEONE strolls over as his guards untie the boy.
SOMEONE eyes him.
SOMEONE's smile diminishes.
SOMEONE chuckles to himself.
Now SOMEONE leads SOMEONE and SOMEONE through a passage.
He brings them to a vast armory.
SOMEONE peers through a scope.
She takes the sniper rifle. In a corridor, SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE.
The boy gazes up at him.
SOMEONE envisions Ghost Rider urinating fire from left to right.
He doubles over.
He sits up straight and SOMEONE nods.
SOMEONE meets his devilish gaze.
SOMEONE faces forward.
SOMEONE nods for one of guards to bring him a small case.
He takes out a syringe then turns to his son.
As a guard restrains the boy, SOMEONE injects SOMEONE through the neck.
SOMEONE smiles as the child loses consciousness. He stands upright.
He returns the syringe to its case.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE follow SOMEONE, climbing to the top of an ancient structure
which overlooks the amphitheater in the surrounding ruins. SOMEONE peers through a binocular, spying on arriving guests. SOMEONE takes a knee.
They watch the guests convene outside.
At dusk above the darkened horizon, scattered clouds roll across the sky.
At night, spotlights illuminate the ancient amphitheater as SOMEONE's guards walk SOMEONE out on stage.
The guards leave the boy kneeling before the guests who sit in six uniform sections, all wearing black robes.
SOMEONE faces his acolytes then raises both arms, gesturing for them to rise from their seats.
SOMEONE lowers his arms and sets his maniacal gaze on SOMEONE who remains on his knees rocking side to side with his head down.
Meanwhile, the cross hairs of a night vision sniper scope move from one guard to the next.
SOMEONE lowers her worried gaze, sets down her rifle, and heads off.
As SOMEONE follows her, SOMEONE returns his gaze to the amphitheater and knocks on a rock wall.
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE out among the ruins.
He lays his hand on her shoulder and she meets his gaze, fidgeting anxiously.
SOMEONE faces her.
He rests his hand on her shoulder.
She glances down then heads off and he turns to watch her go.
Now a half moon shines in the night sky.
SOMEONE's black robed acolytes sway as they chant.
On stage, SOMEONE kneels a few feet away from SOMEONE,
both swaying in unison as though under a spell. We glimpse a few chanting mouths. Meanwhile, the sniper scope targets a guard.
He collapses.
Another goes down.
SOMEONE reloads and takes aim at a third.
She glances up from her green tinted night vision scope then spots four men in a brawl.
She glances up once more then recognizes SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they leave their fallen enemies behind.
Now SOMEONE leads SOMEONE past a wall. He peeks around a corner then crouches with his partner.
He takes a swig of 2000 year old wine.
He hands the bottle to SOMEONE who takes a sip as well.
SOMEONE hands it back.
SOMEONE kisses his friend on each cheek.
He grins.
He grabs his bag and leaves. SOMEONE heads off as well. Now SOMEONE reaches an entryway and chugs his wine.
Two guards trade a look.
He tosses the bottle and shoots them both down.
He kicks a guard.
He reloads then runs up a staircase.
Now SOMEONE darts furtively through a passage in the amphitheater.
He hurdles the low edge of a stone window and peers around a column.
He finds SOMEONE and SOMEONE swaying on their knees before the chanting acolytes.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE slump forward.
The boy raises his head, his eyes bloodshot with black irises.
SOMEONE opens his black bloodshot eyes. SOMEONE creeps closer and shakes his head wrathfully. SOMEONE's lips move.
SOMEONE chants as well. His acolytes tilt their eyes back.
Gazing down on the stage, we find a shadow extending from SOMEONE's body as if reaching for SOMEONE.
SOMEONE runs out in the stands.
He shoots down a guard.
SOMEONE turns and looks up, his eyes returning to normal. As he watches SOMEONE shooting his guards and acolytes, SOMEONE runs onto the stage and punches him out.
SOMEONE runs through the stands shooting more acolytes. He pauses, spreading his arms exultantly. SOMEONE reaches a gloved hand out to SOMEONE.
An unseen force halts it.
SOMEONE stares coldly at SOMEONE through blackened eyes. SOMEONE tries again to reach for him but stops, his neck crooking convulsively. In the stands, SOMEONE arrives and grabs SOMEONE's gun hand. His glove and weapon decay.
SOMEONE sits up.
With a swipe of his hand, he sends SOMEONE flying off the stage. He lands hard in a gravel pit below. In a ring of darkness, SOMEONE decays the priest's right arm in his grasp.
The right side of SOMEONE's head decomposes as he swings his left fist at the demon. SOMEONE catches it easily and forces it down.
SOMEONE sees them.
Darkness closes in around the priest as SOMEONE's grasp decomposes him.
His back arches as the demon snarls. His face a mess of rotten flesh, SOMEONE smashes his head against SOMEONE's. SOMEONE looks on as SOMEONE shakes the rot off his face and out of his hair and mouth.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch the acolytes surround SOMEONE who struggles to stand in the gravel pit.
SOMEONE's hand creeps over his shoulder bringing him back to his knees.
He brings the other hand around to his cheek and holds him by the head. As SOMEONE looks on with a bitter twisted scowl, SOMEONE draws a line of decay across SOMEONE's high forehead. The devil turns and his minion looks up. The acolytes somberly part to reveal SOMEONE walking toward SOMEONE and the weakened SOMEONE.
The demon wrenches his victim's head to face the boy then grins at SOMEONE.
The devil smiles eagerly.
The boy regards him with a knitted brow.
SOMEONE kneels on one knee with the other leg crooked out awkwardly. SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE gives a puzzled scowl.
SOMEONE returns his somber gaze to SOMEONE.
He looks back and forth between the boy and his evil father.
He remember smashing the bottle with his fist and the contract pages flipping by themselves. SOMEONE gives a defeated nod as he recalls signing the contract with his blood. He looks up at SOMEONE.
SOMEONE bares his gritted teeth. SOMEONE runs up to him, seizes him by the shoulders and spews a jet of fire at him.
SOMEONE releases his victim and staggers back, looking on. The flames jetting from SOMEONE's mouth engulf SOMEONE's face. The cursed man accepts the fire with a wide open mouth.
Falling back, SOMEONE lies motionless on the gravel.
On his feet, SOMEONE staggers around as black smoke plumes from his head. The surrounding acolytes recoil as he draws near, his face a swirl of flames. Staring slack jawed, SOMEONE darts away. As SOMEONE halts and doubles over, the acolytes surround him.
SOMEONE helps up SOMEONE.
At her post, SOMEONE turns to find SOMEONE's motorcycle erupting flames as the engine starts by itself.
In the gravel pit, the acolytes close in on SOMEONE. In the sky, a rising sun breaks over a rapid swirl of clouds. Ghost Rider rises, taking out the acolytes with a circular sweep of his red hot chain. All around the amphitheater, posted floodlights explode. Outside, SOMEONE loads a limp SOMEONE into an SUV. Armed men in full body armor rush to surrounding SUVs and trucks. SOMEONE's vehicle speeds away followed by the armed convoy. In the gravel pit, Ghost Rider jerks his head side to side.
He stares at his own gloved hands.
His skeleton head snaps to one side attentively and he marches off. In SOMEONE's SUV, SOMEONE's head slumps forward. His father regards him with a bitter scowl as he leads the convoy at high speed away from ruins. Meanwhile, Ghost Rider marches from the amphitheater to find his flaming motorcycle approaching. It skids to a half before and he climbs on.
The rider speeds off, his chopper trailing thick plumes of black smoke.
Now SOMEONE's convoy travels through a desert on an isolated two-lane highway.
Ghost Rider quickly gains on the trucks.
The rear driver spots him and swerves left, blocking his path. The rider deftly weaves around the truck. A gunman ahead fires rounds from a mounted cannon. They blast holes in the asphalt around the flaming motorcycle but fail to impede it. At the lead, SOMEONE spies the rider in his side mirror and snarls resentfully.
Ghost Rider pulls up beside a ruthless truck as its driver barks into a radio.
He leaps from his motorcycle onto to the driver's side of the cab and shrieks in his face. The driver flies from the truck, landing in the dirt. Ghost Rider leaps onto the driver's seat and takes the wheel. Flames erupt throughout the engine and blaze around the tires.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE drives after the convoy in a dusty SUV, her chin lowered in a determined stare. At the wheel of the flaming truck, the rider thrusts one hand out to the side and gives a taunting shriek. The cannon truck swerves before it, the shooter firing relentlessly. Ghost Rider rear ends it and it explodes. The SUV ahead of it spins out of control, threatening to cut off SOMEONE.
She weaves around it without breaking speed. From below, SOMEONE climbs up on her hood. Crouching playfully, he touches a fingertip to her windshield. A web-like network of cracks spreads across the glass. He drives his fist through the cracks, shattering the windshield. SOMEONE shields her face from the flying glass shards. Ahead, an SUV carrying gunmen pulls up beside Ghost Rider's truck. The flaming vehicle knocks it off the road. The rider turns. Behind him, SOMEONE reaches a hand toward SOMEONE.
Ghost Rider slings his chain. SOMEONE lurches. With a tug, the rider yanks him off SOMEONE's hood and onto the bed of his possessed truck. SOMEONE grabs the chains which start to rot in his grasp.
His smug grin vanishes. The rider tugs the chain, pulling him down and leaps over him. Recovering, SOMEONE grabs him from behind.
The rider elbows him then knocks him back.
His chain rises by itself, winding around the demon.
SOMEONE dances away from it and meets the rider in a grappling hold.
The mad angel leaps from the bed and together they fly through darkness. Twin lights flare below them.
They're SOMEONE's headlights. The grappling foes land on her SUV's hood. SOMEONE head butts the rider who punches him. The demon rolls over on top of him but the angel throws him into the air. As SOMEONE lands back on the hood, his foe flings him off. The rider peers toward the road, looking for his enemy. SOMEONE climbs up the SUVs rear and over the roof. The foes reconverge in a wrestling grasp on the hood. Shifting gears, SOMEONE accelerates and rear ends an SUV knocking it off the road. SOMEONE bends the rider over the side of the hood.
Darkness fills the sky and Ghost Rider's flames sputter weakly.
His flames reignite in a wild blaze as he lifts his skull. He seizes SOMEONE by the head and brings his face close, his jaw opening wide. His cocky smirk gone, SOMEONE stares fearfully through glistening bloodshot eyes. The rider's flames catch on his long stringy hair. The vengeful creature flings SOMEONE to the road where he decomposes instantly.
Ghost Rider's skull snaps around, catching sight of SOMEONE's SUV ahead. His flaming motorcycle pulls up alongside SOMEONE's vehicle then creeps ahead. The gypsy woman shifts gears and accelerates. Ghost Rider leaps from her hood, landing on his motorcycle. Its thick trails of black smoke obscure our view as we follow him up the highway. SOMEONE's side mirrors show Ghost Rider gaining.
As he draws closer, he slings his glowing chain forward. It lashes around the undercarriage's central rod. Ghost Rider gives his chain a tug.
SOMEONE lurches and the auto part flies past the rider.
The SUV swerves off the road then flips end over end.
It lands on its roof in a flaming wreck.
Ghost Rider pulls up beside it, dismounts from his motorcycle and marches toward the vehicle with a steady purposeful gait.
He finds SOMEONE crawling laboriously from the wreck.
His aging wounded vessel limp from the chest down, the devil drags himself across the sand.
Ghost Rider's gloved hand snatches him by the shoulder then hauls him to his feet.
SOMEONE's twisted features scowl bitterly as the rider shrieks in his face.
Ghost Rider throws him down then slings him skyward with a chain around his chest. SOMEONE hovers helplessly in his bonds high above the earth.
The rider snaps the chains, slinging the devil into the ground.
Our view zooms down the chain to a seemingly bottomless pit.
Following the chain, we find SOMEONE plunging into a sea of fire.
His limbs flailing, he steers helplessly as the flames eat away at his flesh.
The hell fires flare, their light overwhelming our view.
In the light of a high bright sun, Ghost Rider crosses his arms over his chest. He spreads them wide, lifting his palms and skeleton face exultingly toward the heavens. He sways side to side, his fleshless mouth working in a growing roar.
Ghost Rider doubles over then arches back triumphantly. He slumps forward and lingers in stillness.
He turns his head.
Several yards away, SOMEONE crests a ridge at dogged run.
She lurches to halt at the sight of Ghost Rider standing beside the overturned flaming SUV.
The creature's skull turns toward the wreckage. As SOMEONE watches, Ghost Rider circles the vehicle, looking down.
He halts.
He glances back toward SOMEONE and lowers his gaze again. 
His gloved hands reach out uncertainly and he lowers out of view. SOMEONE wavers on her feet, her breath coming in ragged gasps. She steps forward as Ghost Rider stands, cradling SOMEONE's limp form in his arms.
Ghost Rider carries the boy to his mother.
SOMEONE staggers woefully as he nears then sinks to her knees.
The rider bends down, laying SOMEONE in her arms.
She tilts the boy's head back gently.
SOMEONE raises a skeletal hand enveloped in blue flames.

SOMEONE lowers his chin and narrows his eyes.
On a nighttime highway,
a skeletal biker blazes with blue flame.

Meanwhile, SOMEONE peers up through an awning and sees a figure dash past an open-air window in the tower.
A solider peeks out from the warehouse.

Now we soar over the city's crowded buildings to an area lush with vegetation. As we reach a palatial building, words appear - Coalition Provisional Authority
Dom's Republican Palace. Inside, Clark addresses high ranking soldiers and officials in a video conference.
A staffer shifts her uncomfortable gaze from SOMEONE to Clark.
Clark coldly shuffles his paperwork.
Now in a quiet residential neighborhood, an Iraqi man in a taupe suit patrols the sidewalk with an assault rifle.
Guard at an intersection. A fourth keeps lookout from a building's rooftop. A white SUV charges up the street then breaks by the man in the taupe suit. Nearby, a thin balding Iraqi with a mustache beneath his aquiline nose limps to a dusty grey car. Glancing across the street, he spots the guards escorting a cluster of well-dressed men away from the white SUV. The bystander gets in his dusty car, keeping an eye on the group as General SOMEONE leads them through a gate. Staring with parted lips, the bystander discreetly drives away. Inside a crowded living room, a middle-aged man lights a cigarette. SOMEONE enters the home and his host extends a hand.
They kiss cheeks and SOMEONE joins the other men in the living room.
They get to their feet. An older bald gentleman respectfully kisses SOMEONE's cheeks.

As SOMEONE makes his way around the pool, two guys in board shorts amble past, both casually toting semi-automatics. The soldier heads to SOMEONE's small patio table and takes a seat.

Scanning down the page, SOMEONE finds links to more of SOMEONE's articles. Sulochana Security Review, Iraqi chemical weapons programs, evidence of toxins at WMD sites, and IO agents and gas at an Iraqi university.
Focusing intently on the screen, SOMEONE reads an article entitled, News Source Confirms Iraq WMD Program. As his eyes scan the text, he takes note of specific phrases. A high ranking Iraqi official code named Magellan gave compelling information about Iraq's WMD program. Magellan identified specific site locations. The soldier blinks thoughtfully at the article's mention of botulin toxin at a facility at Diwaniya, an underground storage network at SOMEONE Monsieur.

SOMEONE rides in the passenger seat.
Now the white Jeep splashes through a puddle as it drives down a desolate road.

He pats the civilian down. Beside them, a guard seated at a desk watches a basketball game on TV. The soldier inspecting SOMEONE's backpack finds plastic wrapped stacks of bills inside. He shows the sergeant.
The guard inspects SOMEONE's belongings.
They head into a narrow hallway where doors with padlocked bolts line the walls every five feet. A man hangs his hands into the hall through a slot at the bottom of his door. He reaches out as SOMEONE passes.
The guide stops a few doors down.
He secures his leg irons to a ring in the floor.
The guard removes the man's hood and tosses it on the table then posts himself in the corner of the room. SOMEONE stares at him.
He exits. Facing the detainee,
SOMEONE checks his watch. The prisoner's chest heaves, streaks of blood staining his cheek.
He glances uneasily at SOMEONE who waits with his hands on his hips. As the civilian averts his gaze and fidgets, the detainee eyes them nervously.
SOMEONE stoically checks his watch again.
They head down a corridor.
A guard opens a chain-linked gate for them and they turn a corner. As the strapping guard unlocks a cell, SOMEONE eyes two guards in a comfy caged in office. 
In the cell, SOMEONE lies prostrate on the floor, his back to the door. SOMEONE nudges him with his foot and SOMEONE's chest heaves.
The strapping guard hesitates. SOMEONE props up SOMEONE's head.
The battered SOMEONE murmurs.
Blood and bruises mar his face.
SOMEONE's body.
SOMEONE leans close and the prisoner winces.
SOMEONE enters.
SOMEONE stands and backs off.
The mustached man and a cohort pull on ski masks and grab guns. Now in a safe house, three aides in business suits
sit on a couch playing cards at a coffee table. A burly man with a trim goatee trudges in.
The burly man nods and ambles off. In a back room, a dignified man assembles a bomb at a well-lit desk. He twists two wires together.

In a control room, a grey haired tech answers a phone.
He hangs up and strides into SOMEONE's cubicle.
Headlights flicker then turn off. Behind him, the Humvee cuts its headlights as well. The vehicles drive onward through the shadows then slow to a stop. SOMEONE and his squad climb out.
As an armed soldier mounts the roof of the Humvee, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE on foot to the mouth of the alley.
He falls back behind the chief. Creeping along a wall, SOMEONE peeks out at compound across the street where several busses sit parked. The soldier studies them carefully then faces his men.
Leaving his men behind, SOMEONE strides out into the street and heads for the bus station. Scanning his desolate surroundings, he passes an abandoned hatchback.
Back at the alley, SOMEONE peeks around the corner and watches the chief pass a tall boxy bus. SOMEONE glances at it then arrives at the two-story cement ticketing kiosk. Graffiti covers its walls and bars protect its windows. The chief slows then wearily circles to the back of the building and halts.
A dog trots across a street and takes cover under a parked bus.
SOMEONE looks over his shoulder and spots one of his men stalking out the alley and across the street following his path. Clutching his weapon, the soldier ducks into a shadow and vanishes. SOMEONE strolls forward uneasily.

Now, journalists crowd a press conference. As a camera flashes, a pentagon official struts in and takes his place.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE hurries down a stairwell. At the bus station, SOMEONE prowls behind a row of parked buses.

He glances at an Iraqi woman in an upper window, then radios in.
Now, his four team members emerge from the alley and take up positions. Scant light and shadows crisscrossing the street play across SOMEONE's face as he advances. Ahead, SOMEONE's envoy breaks into a run and disappears around a corner. SOMEONE crosses another intersection, his gaze searching for a visual on the stranger. A block or so behind, one of his men scopes the street with a night vision lens.

SOMEONE seizes SOMEONE by the collar.
SOMEONE's calm harsh gaze glares at SOMEONE who searches the general's eyes. The high ranking Iraqi lets go and nods to his gunman who rifle butts SOMEONE in the face.

SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a parting look then lumbers away.
SOMEONE grimly regards the fallen general, lowers his rifle, and heads back through the marketplace. Small fires burn here and there amid the tattered stalls. As our view drifts above the surrounding buildings, a passing Humvee's headlights sweep over a nearby wall. We peer out over the nighttime city as explosions flash.

Near the entrance, he gravely takes in the crowd of journalists.

As he and others reach a meeting room, SOMEONE welcomes them. SOMEONE grins at the pentagon official.

He ducks through a large gear with thick spokes then races up a spiral staircase.
Turning down another narrow hallway with steam rising through the grating, the boy reaches another clock powered by a complex mechanism of spinning gears.
He peers through the clock's open numbers at a toy shop below. Surrounded by dolls, rocking horses, musical instruments, and other items, a bearded white-haired man sits behind the counter with his chin propped on one hand.
The man glances sideways and narrows his eyes as he studies the clock.
The boy stares back through the number four.
The man releases a wind-up mouse, watches it scoot across the counter, 
then retrieves it. 
A brown-haired girl wearing a beret steps up beside the man and sets down a loaf of bread. 
He gestures towards the back of the shop. 
The girl stands and smiles at the man. Looking at her, he shrugs then nods emphatically. 
Slowly, she turns and walks away with the bread. The boy watches as the man lowers his head and shuts his eyes.
His hands rest on the counter, a few inches from the wind-up mouse. Crouching, the boy leaves the clock and scuttles along a crawlspace beneath the walkway.
He swings open a small metal grate then steps into a tiled corridor, opposite the shop.
Confiserie et Juet, or candy and toy shop.
Wearing a tattered coat, shorts, and sweater, the boy creeps toward the store.
The white-haired man dozes behind the counter. As the boy reaches the toy shop, he reaches one hand toward the wind-up mouse.
The man suddenly snatches his arm.
The mouse falls and breaks.
The boy reaches into his coat pocket then sets items onto the counter: a pocketknife, bundle of string, and a piece of cloth filled with small sprockets, gears, and springs.
The boy glances over his shoulder then reaches into his other pocket. Glaring at the man, he takes out a small notebook and slaps it onto the counter.
The man releases the boy's arm then opens the notebook.
He frowns as he flips through the pages.
Handwritten notes, mathematical equations, and schematic drawings fill the pages.
The man inhales sharply as he flips to drawings of a mechanical man's head and torso.
The shopkeeper squeezes his eyes shut. As he rapidly flips the pages, the drawings become an animation of the automaton turning its head.
The man shakes the notebook in the boy's face then frowns and slaps it onto the counter.
Across the station, the station inspector lifts his head.
The station inspector removes the leash from his dog, who then runs off. The inspector limps through the crowd after him.
The dog skids across the polished floor as he runs up the hallway opposite the toyshop. The boy spins around then takes off into the crowd.
Swinging out his unbending left leg as he runs, the inspector follows after them.
He slams into a woman, spins, then falls on top of her. The five-piece band plays in the cafe as the boy leaps over a bench and upsets a dining table.
The boy zips through the cafe, then weaves his way through tables out front.
A woman clutches a small little dog to her chest as the Doberman skids past a large tiered cake, races past the band, then runs out of the other side of the cafe. The station inspector dashes into the cafe.
Hurtling toward the cake, the inspector turns and crashes into the band. He puts his foot through a bass guitar and falls into the band members. The inspector struggles to his feet.
Gripping a SOMEONE club, the inspector runs out the other end of the cafe.
Up ahead, the boy dashes through the crowd then slides under a newspaper vendor's legs.
The inspector shoves past the man, then pushes his way into a throng of travelers standing on a train platform.
He limps up the platform along the edge of the tracks, pushing people out of the way as he goes.
The inspector reaches the end of the platform and gazes around himself.
His dog paces in a circle. Above them, the boy paces along a narrow catwalk, running across the tracks as a train leaves the station.
The inspector throws down his club.
The passing train snags the inspector's leg brace.
He falls and the train drags him along the platform.
He slides into a suitcase, which strikes him in the crotch. The dog lies down and lowers his head. Meanwhile, the boy jogs up a grimy corridor filled with gears and steaming pipes. He crawls through a gap in a mesh screen then hops through the spokes of a large gear as it spins. The boy turns down a hallway then opens a metal door.
He peeks inside.
Reaching into a pocket, the boy takes out a set of keys as he approaches another metal door.
He slides a latch then shoves open the heavy door.
The boy enters an attic with a wood-plank floor and shuts the door behind him.
Light shines in through narrow windows along the slanted ceiling and illuminates spinning gears and exposed steel girders.
The boy crosses to a small area in front of three large windows which has been swept clean.
He steps to a worktable covered in gears, sprockets, and schematic drawings.
He picks up one gear and compares it to a drawing,
then tosses it aside.
Setting his jaw, the boy leaves.
He climbs down a metal ladder to a large square clock suspended over train station platforms.
Inside, the boy attaches a handle to the clockwork mechanism and cranks it.
He oils a gear then stares down at the crowd below.
Outside the cafe, the brown-haired woman still holds her little dog to her chest.
The news vendor - a rotund man wearing glasses and a beret - approaches the woman.
She nods and the man reaches his hand toward her dog.
The boy smiles.
Later, he trudges up a metal staircase inside a square tower. Clouds of steam rise up the lofty tower and drift past an enormous pendulum swinging back and forth.
At the top, large clocks face out from every side. Each controlled by a single mechanism with immense gears. Inching around some stray pigeons, the boy climbs a stepladder beside the mechanism and switches on a lightbulb hanging from a chain.
He cranks a thick handle protruding from the side of the mechanism.
Stopping his efforts, the boy gazes out the center of a clock face.
The sun sets behind the Eiffel Tower in the distance.
Slowly, he creeps forward and stares out through the clear glass.
He stands motionless at the top of the clock tower, as the setting sun casts long shadows over the train station and the rest of the sprawling city.

Hurrying his pace, he falls in step beside the man - who doesn't acknowledge SOMEONE's presence.
They approach a gate leading to a cemetery filled with snow dusted statues of hooded figures standing with their hands clasped and their heads bowed.
SOMEONE stares up at the statues as he passes.
The man walks out of a gate on the opposite side then enters a building's front door- which he shuts in SOMEONE's face.
SOMEONE furrows his brow.
He steps back and stares up at the building as a train passes along an elevated track nearby.
The girl who visited the shopkeeper earlier is visible in an upper window.
In the window beside it, the shopkeeper steps beside a curly-haired woman.
SOMEONE tosses a pebble at the girl's window.
She stands and looks down at him.

Smiling, the girl nods.
SOMEONE nods back then turns and runs through the small cemetery.
Back in the attic, SOMEONE lights a candle and sets it onto a chair seat.

Back in the train station, tears well in SOMEONE's eyes.
In a museum, SOMEONE's father furrows his brow as he studies a mechanical model of a large sphere with orbiting satellites.
Standing by a rotating film reel, he glances back over his shoulder and frowns.
SOMEONE's father walks through the museum,
passing a sarcophagus adorned with the figure of a pope.
He steps slowly past marble statues and other works of antiquity and gazes at a pair of closed doors.
As he throws open the doors, flames twist up a staircase and engulf him.

As he turns his head to stare at it, the Roadster approaches a spike strip laid across the street.
It blows out the car's tires.

SOMEONE paces, then faces SOMEONE.
Brushing her hair back, he finds a sizable diamond stud on her earlobe.

SOMEONE bends over and puts his hands into two gloves inside the suit. As he stands, the suit expands, covering SOMEONE's entire body. Small armored plates pop vertically out of the suit, then fold down to form a layer of protective metal. Other metal plates pop up from behind SOMEONE's neck, and cover his head, to form a red helmet and a silver mask with glowing eyes. With his foot, SOMEONE - or Iron Man - pushes the limousine yards away with one foot. Iron Man turns and raises his left hand toward SOMEONE. A glowing circle appears in Iron Man's hand.

Later, the disassembled model, stacked in four panels, rises out of the passenger seat of SOMEONE's convertible, as he drives down a highway. In his basement laboratory, SOMEONE blows dust off the assembled model.
A holographic image of the scale model appears, overlapping the actual model.
SOMEONE lifts the holograph with both hands and turns.
SOMEONE lowers the holograph and pushes it out in front of himself.
He snaps his fingers, then spins the holograph and sits. As the holograph slows to a stop, it turns sideways. The holograph of Unisphere hovers at eye level.
The center of the Unisphere.
The Unisphere glows bright white. SOMEONE draws a circle in the air with his finger. As he moves his hands apart, the Unisphere expands.
He studies the sphere and the surrounding architecture on the holographic model.
As SOMEONE touches and flicks images on the holograph, they disappear.
Moving his hands, SOMEONE expands the Unisphere again.

Facing SOMEONE, the robotic arm taps its three fingers together. SOMEONE smiles, then stands and walks across the room.
SOMEONE swings a sledgehammer and knocks holes in a concrete wall.
He jackhammers a hole in the floor, exposing an electrical junction box. He connects cables to the box, then breaks a hole through the living room floor above into the ceiling of his laboratory. He drops the cables through the ceiling, down to the lab floor.
In the lab, he opens a wooden crate containing massive tubes. He takes out the tubes and assembles them.
Later, he completes the construction of a particle accelerator which incorporates the long tubes. The accelerator extends across the entire house.
SOMEONE walks downstairs into the basement, punches in the security code, and enters SOMEONE's lab.
SOMEONE lifts a red, white, and blue shield from a crate.
As SOMEONE lifts a section of the tubing, SOMEONE slides the shield underneath.

Later wearing goggles, SOMEONE inserts a prism into the accelerator and activates it.
Across the room, a circular metal casing houses a triangular core.
The accelerator shoots beams of light through the prism.
Using a pipe wrench, SOMEONE turns a wheel which rotates the prism, directing the beam outside the tubing.
Firing from left to right toward the triangular core, the beam burns a line in the wall which drips with flames.
The beam cuts off the top half of a huge file cabinet as SOMEONE points the beam at the center of the core.
The triangular core glows brighter and brighter inside its casing.
SOMEONE shuts off the accelerator.

As SOMEONE trudges through the gates, the only student not wearing his uniform, his eyes lock on the golden caps studding the doors.

He nervously peers through a window as he passes the rowdy group undetected.
He scurries from the cab to a parked car and crouches behind it.
Across the street, a vendor shoos the unruly boys away and they move on.
Now, SOMEONE creeps beside the car, his eyes moving from window to window, watching SOMEONE and the boys pass.
He hurries behind another parked car and sees them halt on a stoop.
A few sit.
With a defeated look, SOMEONE squats behind the car and waits.
His eyes shift to a grimy steam vent on the side of a building.
Filthy water drips from it into a bucket.

Dirty water splashes them. Gaping, SOMEONE glances around and spots SOMEONE racing down the street. He and his friends give chase.
SOMEONE sprints down the street, passing vendors with their carts. SOMEONE and his friends follow him across a road and into an alleyway. SOMEONE topples a stack of boxes, knocking them in front of his pursuers. Around a corner, men load items into the back of a truck. SOMEONE scales a pile of boxes beside them and climbs onto a roof.
Behind him, SOMEONE swiftly follows.
Half the boys acrobatically navigate the roof. The other half track SOMEONE from the alley. As SOMEONE touches back down to the street, SOMEONE's crew course after him through an alley filled with old tires. SOMEONE defensively tips over a stack of bottle-filled crates, but SOMEONE and his friends quickly surmount them. SOMEONE races through a set of double doors in a six-foot-high wall, then pulls them shut.
He finds a piece of wire hanging from a nearby hook and laces it through two eyelets on the doors, binding them together. As SOMEONE's crew struggle to open the doors, SOMEONE steps back and waits. SOMEONE leaps over the wall.
SOMEONE bolts and SOMEONE springs after him. Another boy leaps over the wall, then opens the doors for his friends. Following SOMEONE, the group races behind residential buildings, where drying clothes hang on lines. SOMEONE reaches the outer gate of his apartment complex, and races through its wide green doors, into a courtyard by the maintenance shed.
He halts as he notices the closed inner gate.
He glances around frantically, then hurries to the maintenance shed's doors and rattles them.
Turning from the locked shed, he sees SOMEONE and his cronies enter the courtyard.
SOMEONE tries to climb over the inner wall, but SOMEONE grabs him and throws him to the ground. SOMEONE hastily stands and backs away, as SOMEONE and two others close in on him.

Mr. SOMEONE waits in a fighting stance, his wrists crossed in an X shape.
He blocks a strike and holds a tall boy against his body. As a younger boy kicks, Mr. SOMEONE blocks the attack with the tall boy.
He pulls the young kicker in, uses him as a shield against the tall boy, then flips the younger into a trash barrel. SOMEONE and the others rush SOMEONE, who deflects their blows. He sends two slamming into each other, chest to chest, then bonks another flat with his own chest. He lifts one boy by his britches, and swings him in a circle, letting his sneakered feet whack another boy flat.
In a move like ballroom dancing, SOMEONE spins the controlled boy out, and the kid's loose-swinging arm slaps another boy in the face. Now, SOMEONE grips the boy's wrists in one hand, and draws back his fist to punch. The boy cringes.
As SOMEONE lowers his fist, an older boy attacks. Mr. SOMEONE absorbs, then redirects the strike into a boy's face. Now, as SOMEONE fends off several boys simultaneously, SOMEONE lifts his head and watches the fight.
Mr. SOMEONE grabs the arms of a boy in a warm-up jacket. He tangles a sleeve around the arm of another boy, and wraps the other sleeve around the jacket-wearer's neck.
He catches a third boy's leg in the sleeve, then guides his foot into SOMEONE's chest. He pushes the tangled boys to the ground. As he turns back to SOMEONE, a small boy steps toward him.
Mr. SOMEONE gives him a look and the boy backs away. His chest heaves as he turns from the group.

Now, Mr. SOMEONE and SOMEONE pass through the gates to the kung fu school, where the throngs of red-clad students hang out.
Inside the studio, two students spar while the others kneel around the edges of the platform. Their instructor sits on a bench and watches. Mr. SOMEONE scans his surroundings as he and SOMEONE enter.
One of the sparring boys throws his opponent to the mat.
Grabbing him by his shirt, the aggressor lifts the boy, then drops on his back, and flings him over his head.

As one boy attacks, the other blocks him, then grabs his arm, and flips him to the floor.
He crouches over his fallen opponent, draws back his fist, and hesitates.
The boy brutally punches his opponent in the face.
Looking on, Mr. SOMEONE swallows uneasily.
The winning student approaches his instructor, his eyes averted.
The square-jawed man rises from his bench and faces the boy, who shifts his eyes nervously.
The instructor ceremoniously raises his open hand and smacks the boy's cheek.
The boy stumbles.
The students stand at attention, their arms behind their backs, and their eyes straight ahead.
We do not stop when our enemy is down. No mercy.

SOMEONE blocks, deflects, and swats his teacher's attacks. SOMEONE seizes the stunned boy by the shoulders.
Sunlight flares around SOMEONE's intense gaze. He releases the boy and shuffles off.
SOMEONE watches, slack-jawed, as the kung fu master hobbles into his living room.
The student retrieves his jacket and whirls it around his shoulders.
He pauses, then spins it off and whips it around his body again.
He continues sweeping the jacket around his body, practicing as he heads out of the courtyard.
Now, we soar over an emerald-hued mountain range with conical peaks, drifting over a ridge, we spy a train winding its way alongside a tranquil muddy river. On a crowded passenger car, SOMEONE gazes out a window at the exotic landscape.
Mr. SOMEONE dozes beside him.
SOMEONE shifts his puzzled gaze.
Mr. SOMEONE faces him wearily.
Leaning across SOMEONE, SOMEONE draws a character on the dusty window.
As he settles back into his seat, his student gazes solemnly at the character for chi.
Mr. SOMEONE gives him a wry look.
Now on the station platform, Mr. SOMEONE leads SOMEONE off the train and hails a motorcycle taxi. Later, as it travels along a winding road overlooking the mountains, SOMEONE and his student ride on the rear-facing back seat.
The teacher smiles at the boy, who happily takes in the stunning terrain. The taxi crosses a lofty stone bridge spanning the tranquil river.
Later, they arrive at a stairway leading down to a footbridge. Beyond it, a path winds up into the mountains.
They descend the stone steps.
SOMEONE eyes a tall distant peak haloed by the sun.
Now, monks in snowy robes and canary-yellow scarves sit in lotus position, along the rim of a stone dam.
Water streams past them, down the glossy rocks.
Now, a jagged peak looms high above mountains patched with snow.
Our view tilts down to a dizzyingly long stairway beneath us.
Mr. SOMEONE marches up the narrow steps, followed by his student.
One section of the stairs rests on a fin of rock
barely wider than the stairway itself.
They ascend the steep run.
Later, at another section, SOMEONE stops, leaning against a stone banister.
Mr. SOMEONE continues up without breaking his stride. Now, we drift over an elaborate mountaintop monastery.
Rust-red walls support ancient rib-tiled roofs.
Mr. SOMEONE leads his pupil up onto a small balcony, then along a shadowy corridor.
It leads them into a stone courtyard where dozens of male and female monks, in snowy tunics, perform tai chi.
With fluid grace, they execute the meditative movements in perfect unison.
On a balcony, a man in a navy tunic rapidly twirls a fighting staff around his lithe frame. As Mr. SOMEONE leads SOMEONE past, the monk crouches on one foot,
balancing on his staff, as he extends his other leg, parallel to the ground.
Where two railings make a corner, a monk does a split from one to the other, and snaps open a large fan.
SOMEONE swallows, staring at the magnificent feat.
Venturing onward, the boy spies a third monk sitting in the lotus pose.
From a pair of twin platforms, he pushes himself up by his knuckles, and balances.
Now, an enclosed walkway stands built into a high cliff face. Mr. SOMEONE leads SOMEONE inside, glancing out the windows as he marches along.
Following his gaze, the boy halts in his tracks.
Outside, a woman in a white tunic faces the drop-off.
She crouches, revealing a cobra poised before her, its hood fanned out.
Slack-jawed, the boy runs to another window. The female ascetic stands on an ornamental-stone jut over the 1,000-foot drop. As she straightens, the reptile rises to match her.
Balancing on one foot, the woman sweeps an arm in an arc behind her head, and holds the other gently crooked before her.
The disciple tucks her extended leg in briefly, and folds her arms across her torso, then lifts her knee up to her chest, and extends her arms in a slanted T, pointing down at the serpent.
Her eyes wide, the woman slowly tilts her head, side to side,
her sharp-featured gaze fixed on the snake.
The cobra mirrors her, weaving left and right.
As SOMEONE stares at the spectacle, his head tips side to side as well.
Further down the corridor, Mr. SOMEONE stops.
Doubling back, he steps into the light as he finds his pupil entranced by the woman's practice.
He allows a faint smile and shifts his gaze.
The boy turns, wide-eyed. Mr. SOMEONE beckons with a wave of his hand.
SOMEONE gives one last look to the exquisite spectacle, then follows his teacher to a doorway.
SOMEONE removes his hat.
A basin stands paved with the Yin-Yang of black and white marble.
The basin stands upon a compass-like framework of white stone that's submerged in a shallow pool.
Mr. SOMEONE gazes reverently upon the well, then faces SOMEONE, and nods toward the water.
The boy solemnly steps up on one of the white-stone beams and approaches the basin.
The boy lays his hands on the rim. He plunges his face into the water. Mr. SOMEONE smiles as his pupil drinks eagerly.
SOMEONE lifts his dripping face.
He watches his teacher roaming the chamber wistfully.
He imitates the woman.
Mr. SOMEONE steps up on the latticework and joins his pupil at the basin.
He regards SOMEONE with a thoughtful nod, then points at the water.
SOMEONE ripples the water with his finger.
He points to SOMEONE's head and heart.
Now on a lakeside dock, SOMEONE attaches bamboo poles to SOMEONE's wrists by loops at their ends.
Mr. SOMEONE steps back, gripping a bamboo pole in each hand.
He moves SOMEONE's hand to his head.
He puppets the boy.
SOMEONE tips him over the dock's edge and holds him inches from the water.
Now, a train's headlights cut through the night air. In a passenger car, SOMEONE sleeps with his cheek on Mr. SOMEONE's shoulder.
As he stirs, his head flops down to his teacher's lap.
The man stares at the boy, then slowly rests a hand on his back.
He gives SOMEONE a gentle pat, then looks away, and takes a deep breath. 
Now, Mr. SOMEONE puts SOMEONE to bed, as SOMEONE looks on.    
The mother smiles at the man, then goes to her sleeping son.She kisses SOMEONE's forehead and caresses his cheek. 
SOMEONE returns to the bedroom doorway, where Mr. SOMEONE looks on with a fond smile. The quickly closing door thins the shaft of light cast on the boy until it's gone.
Now, a child's drawing shows a coiled cobra with a fanned hood. A dotted line connects his eyes to the eyes of the slender woman striking a kung fu pose.
Sitting at a sunlit desk, SOMEONE hunches over a sketchbook and shades in the woman's hair. Now, he stares intensely at his mother, as they lunch in a marketplace.
SOMEONE frowns at her glowering son, then glances over her shoulder.
Later, he and SOMEONE bow, each signing a fist-to-palm gesture.
Now, SOMEONE limbers SOMEONE up, bending him over his knee, then pushing him into a full split. Next, SOMEONE works the water pump with precise arm movements. SOMEONE has a go, but struggles. Now, trying elevated push-ups, SOMEONE collapses. SOMEONE hangs a bell high above SOMEONE's head. The boy kicks at it unsuccessfully. On a roof, a hanging bed sheet separates them.
A boxing glove smacks him. The glove's attached to a pole.
SOMEONE peeks under the sheet.
The glove smacks him again.
He jabs SOMEONE's stomach.
In his courtyard, SOMEONE lobs tennis balls at SOMEONE. On the roof, he jabs again.
He gives another smack.
He jabs SOMEONE again, then steps around the sheet and faces him.
Now, SOMEONE holds a bamboo staff across his shoulders as he executes moves under SOMEONE's command.
In the rain, the teacher demonstrates a squatting leg sweep. In clear weather, he holds SOMEONE's ankles as the boy does handstand push-ups. The boy kicks at the bell with improved grace, but still misses. In his room, he poses at a mirror, and falls over.
Nighttime. In his living room, Mr. SOMEONE waxes the refinished car.
Pausing, Mr. SOMEONE faces the boy.
As SOMEONE leaves, Mr. SOMEONE slows his gaze pensive.
Now at school, the American boy turns down the brief corridor. At the other end, he spots SOMEONE standing outside the auditorium,
staring at a posting on the door. He joins her.
She leaves.
SOMEONE looks past her shoulder and freezes.
SOMEONE takes her by the wrist.
They run from the school, hand in hand. SOMEONE freezes, spotting a guard at the gate.
He leads SOMEONE around a pillar. He peeks around, signals for SOMEONE to be quiet, then leads her at a sprint down the sidewalk.
Now, they arrive at a vendor selling fried insects on sticks. A metal bowl writhes with live bugs and scorpions. SOMEONE selects a stick of fried scorpions, and thrusts it playfully in SOMEONE's face. She smirks as he recoils.
She chases him with it. From overhead, we watch numerous umbrellas part to make way for them. Now, they run among jetting-fountain plumes outside the Olympic Stadium. SOMEONE clutches SOMEONE's violin case as she chases him. Later, they gaze at the still water.
He disrupts it with his hand.
SOMEONE faces the water and blinks.
Now, the two hurry down a crowded escalator. In an arcade, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE to a digital dance game, faces its touch screen, and makes a selection from a list.
She leaves SOMEONE on the dancer's platform, claps her hands, and nods encouragingly.
Facing her, he performs a series of dexterous steps.
As he quivers his body side to side, he twirls his arms in front of his chest, then waggles his legs, making them look like rubber.
SOMEONE reluctantly steps up onto the platform.
She nervously faces the screen, putting her back to SOMEONE. She stands tensely, her shoulders hunched and her fists clenched at her sides. The girl looks over her shoulder, giving SOMEONE an anxious pleading look.
He lifts his brow, smiles, and nods. Words on the screen read, Get ready. SOMEONE nods to herself. She flings her hands out to the side, turns, and flips her hair. She struts toward SOMEONE, gives a shimmy, then pops her bent arms. Under his stunned gaze, she hops her feet out and in, and extends her arms to match. She gracefully shimmies her hips, steps away, then turns and points to SOMEONE.
He glances away briefly, his eyes wide. SOMEONE swirls an arm around her head, as she swivels her hips, then tosses her head side to side. Gliding across the platform, she sweeps a hand beneath her face. SOMEONE stares.
With a modest sigh, she steps down off the platform.
Later, they gaze out from a balcony.
SOMEONE digs out her cell phone. Answering it, she turns away.
She hurriedly ends the call.
Grabbing her violin case, she rushes off. Now, she runs along a sidewalk, with SOMEONE trailing close behind. Reaching a brick pillar, he stops at the sight of a stern man waiting by a black luxury sedan.
As SOMEONE dashes to the car, he gets behind the wheel. A lovely woman rides up front, wearing a worried gaze.
SOMEONE ducks behind the pillar as he watches the car leave.
Shifting his worried gaze, SOMEONE breaks into a run, and sprints down a tree-lined path.
In the school auditorium, a pre-teen boy plays the piano, his fingers moving nimbly over the keys. At the front of the house, a panel of judges watches him intently.
In the back, SOMEONE's instructor shifts anxiously on his feet. On a city street, SOMEONE sprints around pedestrians.
Back in the auditorium, the house lights blink on, and the judges make notes. On stage, members of a small orchestra tune up.
The judges turn as SOMEONE and her mother run in.
Her instructor urges the girl forward, then takes a seat near the back of the house.
SOMEONE arrives on the stage, kneels, and removes her violin from its case.
As her parents take seats near the front of the house, she steps center stage, bows first to the judges, then to the orchestra.
She raises her violin and bow.
One judge knits his brow, while another lowers his folded arms. Mrs. Po looks on with a softened gaze.
SOMEONE's instructor listens, stone-faced.
On stage, the girl plays with closed eyes and a furrowed brow.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE races doggedly down a sidewalk, dodging other pedestrians. He turns into the school gates and dashes through the entrance. Nearing the auditorium, he shoves past waiting young musicians.
Inside, as the instructor watches his pupil, SOMEONE's face pops up in the window behind him.
He sees SOMEONE playing on stage, and steps around the partition.

Beaming, he returns the gesture.
As they follow their daughter's gaze, the parents' smiles fade.
The father clasps his hands behind his back and addresses SOMEONE sternly.
Her joyful grin vanishes.
SOMEONE blinks quizzically at them.
SOMEONE's parents walk her up the aisle, stopping to face the young American boy.
SOMEONE stares at her, crestfallen.
SOMEONE unhappily bites her lip.
Her father pats her shoulder and they continue up the aisle as SOMEONE helplessly watches them go.
SOMEONE approaches, flanked by his friends.
SOMEONE shifts on his feet as they saunter past.
At dusk, SOMEONE shuffles through a teaming marketplace illuminated softly by lanterns in each kiosk.
He pauses and digs his cell phone from his pocket.
The message from his mom reads, Where are you? You need to get home.
SOMEONE pushes a button and the display reads, Message deleted.
Now, SOMEONE enters SOMEONE's house.
He slows, and looks around anxiously, then treads through the kitchen.
SOMEONE steps into the living room and finds SOMEONE bludgeoning the car with a sledgehammer.

The boy's confused gaze drifts.
SOMEONE paces to the driver-side door and plops down behind the wheel.
SOMEONE walks alongside the car, scanning the destroyed vehicle.
In a deep dent on the hood, he notices a newspaper clipping lying under pebbles of shattered glass.
SOMEONE leans closer, then picks the scrap up,
dumping off the glass bits.
The clipping shows photos of a smiling young woman and a pudgy-cheeked young boy.
a third photo shows a wrecked Scirocco,
its front end smashed and bumper hanging
SOMEONE regards the front end of SOMEONE's car and finds it similarly damaged.

Following their guidance, the teacher climbs out of the car.
SOMEONE locks eyes with him and draws him forward, tears shining on his cheeks.
The car's single working headlight flares brightly into the courtyard,
silhouetting the pair, as SOMEONE tugs SOMEONE outside. They descend from SOMEONE's patio and move into the center of the courtyard.
The headlight projects their shadows onto the wall behind them, as the boy maneuvers them into position.
SOMEONE stares at him wearily.
Using both hands, SOMEONE angles a pole upward, raising SOMEONE's hand to his face.

Later in economics, Professor SOMEONE watches his students from his desk. He caps a thermos then sets it near a collection of cellphones and sips from the thermos cup. Sitting at the long tables, the econ students diligently work on their exams. SOMEONE stands. He collects his bag and papers and makes his way to the professor's desk.
He returns SOMEONE's smart phone.
As SOMEONE heads out of the lecture hall the professor lifts his thermos.

Stylish guests relax on the elegant deck.
Boasting a broad chest, narrow waist and dark mustache, SOMEONE gazes out with a love-lorn smile.
As he scans one of the complex's balconies, a swimmer paddles across our view.
From under water, we watch SOMEONE dive in.
A flashback at a school.
A boy peers down into a courtyard.
The teacher holds a beaker full of yellow fluid.
Noticing what's in his hands, he puts it down.
Mortified, SOMEONE glances around the classroom.

He writes on a chalkboard.
The teacher and student stare.
SOMEONE puts the chalk down and resumes his seat.
SOMEONE leaves another chalkboard and resumes his seat.
On a walkway.
A librarian rushes with a book among a throng of students to a classroom.
Inside, SOMEONE fills the chalkboard with numbers.
Several more boards stand filled to his left and students call out each number he writes.
The librarian consults his book.
Back in the present.
The writer averts his eyes.
The writer shrugs good naturedly.
He helps his host bring food to a table and they sit down to lunch.
He graciously serves his guest.
In a flashback, two stylish blondes ride bicycles down a street.
They follow the charming, colorful street toward the sea.

Later in the dark, SOMEONE sits hunched beneath the sheet and uses a flashlight.
His brother sleeping beside him.
SOMEONE turns the pages of a comic book depicting the Krishna story.
A large panel illustrates a smiling Krishna holding his mouth open.
Beyond his lips swirl colorful galaxies, planets, and stars.
As we peer closely at the universe between Krishna's lips, it moves.
With the boy's father.
A barge carrying a depiction of Vishnu floats passed SOMEONE's mother.
Our view lifts up and away from the floating candles to the stars twinkling in the night's sky.
Our view spins, then descends to a sunny day in a lush valley.
Facing his sad-eyed, skinny brother, an adolescent SOMEONE points out a church at the rim of the misty valley.
It overlooks a tranquil river winding through verdant lands.
Now, as we peer out the church's open door.
SOMEONE leans into view with wide eyes.
He slips inside, then creeps to an alcove.
Scooping up water from a basin with his hand, he takes a few sips then turns and takes in the space with a curious reverent gaze.
Now SOMEONE stares across the pews at the alter where golden candlesticks surround a crucified Jesus statue.
His gaze drifts along a high row of paintings and fixates on one.
The priest approaches the boy and offers a glass of water.

Now young SOMEONE sits beside a glimmering river.
He stands and stumbles into the water. Now in the church.
SOMEONE removes his hand from a Vishnu figure and presses his palms together in Christian prayer.
He turns off a lamp and goes to bed.
Now young SOMEONE walks down a dirt road lined with grimy homes. Looking right, he sees dozens of kneeling men bowing, performing Salah in the mosque's courtyard.

SOMEONE continues into a caged area.
He grabs handfuls of raw meat from a table.
He turns a wheel near a gate.
At the zoo.

SOMEONE turns and runs but SOMEONE remains still.
Stopping near the end.
The beautiful animal stares at the boy.
SOMEONE extends a handful of meat between the bars.
SOMEONE glances at a gated off entrance to his side, then slowly stalks down the feeding corridor toward SOMEONE.
The young boy remains still as the tiger nears. Its long striped tail swaying behind.
Keeping his eyes fixed on SOMEONE Parker's, SOMEONE's hand trembles with the slab of meat.
The magnificent tiger stops a foot away.
His ears point backward as he extends his nose to the meat.
SOMEONE's father hurries inside.
The tiger bolts away.
Glaring, his father shakes his head and faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE runs off.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch a zoo keeper enter the room carrying a live goat.
He sets it before the feeding corridor.
Securing its rope leash to the bars, Selvam faces SOMEONE's father.
SOMEONE's mother enters.
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE crosses his arms and stares ahead as Selvam spins the metal wheel.
At the end of the corridor the tiger's gate slides open.
The family stands together facing the gate.
The alarmed goat shakes its head and ears, then spins in a circle.
SOMEONE slowly turns the corner and eyes the goat with his mouth hanging open.
Lowering his head, the intimidating beast stalks forward.
SOMEONE watches as he suddenly springs toward his prey.
SOMEONE winces and SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE against her as SOMEONE remains completely still.
With the goat now on the other side of the bars, SOMEONE pulls it back toward his cage.
With his head pressed to his mother's bosom.
SOMEONE watches the carnivore drag his kill.
Now in bed, teenage SOMEONE reads a Dostoyevsky novel as SOMEONE awakes to an alarm.
Later outside their school, young students rush passed SOMEONE through the rain.

He reads L'Etranger by Albert Camus.
Now a round-faced teenage beauty dances with other girls wearing a vibrant red saari.
SOMEONE plays the dholak drum and watches her closely.
An older teacher sits crossed-legged and chants as teenage girls perform a lively dance. The round-faced girl spins rapidly, catching SOMEONE's gaze on several twirls.

The teacher breaks his trance.
SOMEONE closes his lips and glances at SOMEONE.
She keeps her eyes cast down as her classmates smile.
Later in a bustling marketplace, SOMEONE spies on SOMEONE as she shops with friends.
A girl spots him and he quickly ducks behind colorful hanging items. As SOMEONE and her friends move on, SOMEONE attempts to follow them with the drum satchel draped over his shoulder.
He exits the market and stops, searching in both directions. Now SOMEONE scurries through a section of tall root-like banyan trees where SOMEONE awaits with her friends.
SOMEONE stares at the ground then forms a bowl with his hands.
She furrows her brow.

The young beauty takes his hand.
Now on a freighter ship, SOMEONE leans on the rail of the main deck.

SOMEONE stops beside her boy, following his gaze to the setting sun.
SOMEONE shifts his weight.
SOMEONE eyes her son then walks away.
Blinking rapidly, SOMEONE keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon.
Now in the eating quarters, SOMEONE faces a husky, larged-nosed cook.
The cook reaches behind the counter and puts a morsel of parsley on the plate.
She asked if you have something vegetarian.
The cook glances at the plate.
The cow that produced this liver was vegetarian, the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian.
Very funny but my wife doesn't eat liver.
The cook shrugs and grabs another plate.
Then she can eat the sausage, the rice and the gravy or you can cook your own food.
How dare you talk to my wife like that.
I cook for sailors not curry eaters.
SOMEONE grabs the cook.
The sailors pull SOMEONE away from the crazy-eyed cook.
Now the family sits with their eyes cast down as a teenage Asian boy joins them.
SOMEONE eyes the amiable boy and shakes his head with a smile.
Now below the deck, two orangutans sit in a four by four cage. The larger one takes the smaller one's hand and comforts it.
SOMEONE sits outside the cage, watching them closely and eating a banana.
His father dumps food in an ostrich pen as a camel and giraffe watch attentively.
Stacks of animal crates line the cargo hold.
SOMEONE stares at his son as he shoves pills into a banana.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze to the ship's floor.
Present day on a park bench.
The writer watches him with a furrowed brow as adult SOMEONE stares into the river before them.
The writer nods and grins.
Facing the river, he leans forward.
A map of the South Pacific fills the screen.
We zoom to the Mariana trench.
As we push through thick, churning storm clouds, deck lights illuminate a freighter in the night. Heavy rains pound on the swelling ocean.
Ramping off a wave, the ship's bow lands hard on the seething surface. Water bursts upwards as it skips to another wave.
Below deck, SOMEONE slowly awakes in his cabin bunk.
His eyes dart about. His parents sleep in a bed across the room.
He leans down to the bottom bunk and shakes his sleeping brother.
SOMEONE quickly pulls himself into his bunk as his mother rolls over.
The hands on a travel clock point to 1:17.
SOMEONE climbs a flight of stairs and enters a corridor.
The door swings shut behind him.
He staggers and steadies himself on a railing as he moves along.
Turning, he faces a door with a port hole.
SOMEONE peers through at the lightning flashing in the darkness.
He turns a latch and the door swings open. The wind and rain lash in at him.
Venturing out, SOMEONE leans over a railing and scans his tempestuous surroundings. As he steps along a walkway, his feet slide on the wet flooring.
He stumbles as the ship violently rocks and he catches himself on a banister.
SOMEONE climbs stairs to the neck deck and slides on his bare feet again.
He catches himself on a railing and clings to it as he beams down at the churning, roiling ocean.
Stepping back, he looks skyward and waves his arms giddily.
He struggles to perform a worshipful dance.
Getting to his feet, he notices a red light flashing from a high post. Falling again, SOMEONE slides into a barrier at the edge of the upper deck.
He braces himself and climbs to his feet. The ship plunges into a wave sending water crashing over him.
It leaves the upper deck flooded as he recovers.
SOMEONE watches two sailors moving frantically below with flashlights.
SOMEONE reaches for them futilely as they wash overboard.
Sobered, he races back inside.
He staggers through a corridor.
Finding his level flooded, he dives into the water and swims. He passes a panicking zebra.
SOMEONE surfaces.
Gasping then submerges himself and swims onward.
The teen passes through a dark section lit only by the pulsing red emergency lights.
Reaching a door at the end of the corridor, he struggles to open it.
It springs open releasing a powerful current of water and air bubbles.
SOMEONE hangs onto the door frame and tries futilely to pull himself into his family's quarters.
Releasing it, he drifts back down the corridor and returns to the deck.
An animal leaps passed him.
A bird seeks refuge in the nearby tower. Other animals struggle for footing on the rocking ship.
A sailor gives him a life jacket.
The Buddhist struggles to free a lifeboat carrying the cook.
The Buddhist leaps to SOMEONE.
The Buddhist, captain and the sailor shove him onto the boat. SOMEONE tumbles across the canvas cover and hangs off the edge. The cook signals to the men on the ship.
SOMEONE climbs back up and scrambles around as the others shout at him.
As SOMEONE clings to one set of lines, the cook unfastens another.
The Buddhist points as the zebra at the railing of an upper deck.
The boat tips and the cook falls off.
SOMEONE loses his grip on the lines and the lifeboat plummets to the sea.
SOMEONE lands on his belly and struggles to hold on as the boat bucks on the churning waters. SOMEONE slides backward, landing at a wave that buoys him back on the boat again.
It carries him past the shouting men at the edge of the ship's deck. A giant wave washes them from view.
The lifeboat carries SOMEONE through the wreckage. A boom sweeps low over his head.
Escaping the wreckage, the lifeboat briefly capsizes. As it rights itself, we find SOMEONE holding on tightly and the zebra lying inside. SOMEONE peers across the giant waves and locates the sinking ship. He notices a whistle on his life jacket and blows it.
He frantically waves his arm at the ship.
Peering into the seemingly endless expanse of rolling waves, SOMEONE spots a figure in the water.
Finding a life preserver, he climbs up on the canvas secured tautly over the front half of the boat. He casts the flotation device out into the water with all his might.
The lights of the capsizing ship twinkle and pulse in the distance as SOMEONE uses a line to reel in the drowning figure.
He slides a long handles oar out from beneath the canvas cover and extends it over the water toward the life preserver.
Two paws and a large furry head emerge from the center of the ring.
SOMEONE jabs futilely at the tiger with the oar. A wave carries the beast to the lifeboat's rim.
SOMEONE grabs on and climbs partially aboard. Scrambling to the prow, SOMEONE dives into the water. Getting his bearings, he looks back at the lifeboat, then gazes out over the roiling water. A giant wave looms stories high above him.
SOMEONE takes a deep breath and submerges. The wave briefly rolls him as it passes by.
Staying under, SOMEONE swims past a shark as he makes his way beyond the lifeboat.
Turning, he finds himself facing the completely submerged ship.
The teen halts and hovers in the water.
His limbs splayed as he stares at the enormous craft.
The deck lights glow as the ocean's depths claim the vessel.
SOMEONE looks on helplessly as the ship descends into the deep.
Turning away, he swims.
Two other sharks fight over a fresh kill beneath him. The tempestuous waters swirl over SOMEONE as he makes his way back to the surface.
The teen thrusts his head above water and gasps.
With long strokes, he swims back to the lifeboat.
SOMEONE grabs for a mast jutting five feet from the prow, but a passing wave compromises his reach.
Another carries him to the boat's rim.
SOMEONE climbs on to the deck with the zebra who lies curled up on its side on one end.
Knee-deep water sloshes around the deck.
SOMEONE climbs back on the canvas cover, then scrambles to the prow.
He leans far out, clinging to the mast.
A wave sends a blast of spray into his face.
Shaking his head, he catches his breath and peers down into the water.
Another blast of sea-spray drenches the teen.
He watches helplessly as the ship sinks further beneath the churning waves.
The ocean's rippling surface distorts SOMEONE's view of the lost vessel.
We drift up and away from the boy as the lifeboat carries him over the ship's watery grave.
A section at a time, the deck lights flicker then blink out.
Lightning flashes then diminishes leaving the boy alone in the darkness.
The next day a seemingly endless expanse of choppy waves roll beneath a low ceiling of storm clouds. The lifeboat bobs amidst the whitecaps.
With the life preserver looped over the prow beam, a huddled, shivering SOMEONE sits in the rain while clinging to the mast with his hands.
His feet brace against the front of the boat.
A shark passes beneath him.
Glancing down at it, SOMEONE struggles his way to the canvas covered bow and rolls over on top of the beam.
Lifting the edge of the canvas, he peers inside.
Water sloshes over the floor of the boat.
The water splashes the zebra who still lies curled up on the wooden bench-like seats rimming the far end.
One of its hind legs lies unnaturally straight as it drags its haunch along the bench.
Later, SOMEONE uses a bucket to bail water from the boat.
With weary, dogged motions, he scoops out one bucketful after another.
SOMEONE drops the bucket and collapses on the bench near the canvas cover's edge.
He leans back, his arms draped on the boat's rim and cover.
SOMEONE lifts his head.
A hyena emerges from the canvas shelter.
The hyena darts back under the canvas. As SOMEONE takes up a long handles oar and jumps to the canvas cover.
SOMEONE the hyena darts out. It leaps at SOMEONE clumsily and snaps at the oar. Its jaws clamp on the oars paddle.
SOMEONE drops the oar and retreats to the prow beam.
Clinging by his arms, he swings himself around so his legs dangle over the water.
Curling his abdominal muscles, he lifts his legs and fits them through the life preserver.
From his makeshift seat, he watches SOMEONE mid-boat as the hyena tries to climb up onto the canvas. The beast makes it only half way up, its hind legs staggering with the rocking of the boat.
The spotted hyena keeps its four paws on the canvas, staring at SOMEONE.
It turns its head. SOMEONE follows its gaze, peering across the surf.
From a cresting wave, an orangutan rises into view, perched on a floating bundle.
SOMEONE ducks into the canvas and the zebra stretches its neck toward the approaching ape.
As she draws near, we recognize her flotation device has bananas wrapped in netting.
SOMEONE extends an oar to her and she climbs aboard.
The teen gives her a weary smile then leans over the side of the boat.
In the water, the banana bundles float free of the netting.
SOMEONE gathers up the net.
Pulls out a stray banana and tosses it to Orange Juice.
The orangutan lets it bounce off her shoulder and land on the flooded floor of the boat.
Facing SOMEONE, she grimly works her lips and folds her long arms.
Frowning, the teen peers out over the sea.
As SOMEONE faces her with a concerned expression, the orangutan lowers her gaze and sighs. Turning her head over her shoulder, she gazes off over the water.
SOMEONE blinks understandingly.
SOMEONE settles wearily onto the canvas.
He gives a resigned sigh.
Now flies swarm around the injured zebra, a thin white foam covering its lips.
Standing on the canvas cover, SOMEONE turns.
He drops to all fours and picks up the bucket.
Lying on his belly, he slams it against the boat's hull.
The hyena emerges from beneath the canvas.
Rediscovering SOMEONE, it leaps at him.
The teen scrambles back and fends off SOMEONE with the oar.
The animal gnaws on its paddle.
Orange Juice scoots back on the bench and shrieks as SOMEONE bounds passed her and runs in circles. The hyena briefly leans over the edge the resumes its wild laps as SOMEONE stands ready with the oar.
SOMEONE stops at the center, his body convulsing. He vomits on the floor.
Licking his chops, he makes another try for SOMEONE but slumps weakly against the canvas.
The netting dangles from the base of the prow beam.
SOMEONE sits at the bow sharing a vigilant gaze with the hyena who remains back at the edge of the canvas.
The teen wavers wearily, his eyelids heavy.
Glancing over his shoulder.
SOMEONE bounds to the zebra and snaps at its injured hind leg.
The wounded animal kicks at the predator.
SOMEONE and Orange Juice watch helplessly as SOMEONE kills the zebra.
On a gently rolling current, SOMEONE sits in the makeshift seat at the boats prow, hugging the life preserver.
Dark circles shade his bleary eyes above his red, chapped cheeks.
SOMEONE's eyelids droop and he blinks himself awake.
The teen nods off again.
He falls back into the water, hanging by his knees from the life preserver.
Waking, he jolts up and gasps.
The sputtering teen manages to sit up and catch his breath.
A line of saliva streams from his mouth as he looks around and recovers.
In the boat, the zebra lies dead.
Orange Juice slumps against the edge of the canvas cover taking slow, deep breaths.
He lifts away a hatch beneath the canvas cover and finds a duffle inside. Opening it, he finds a red booklet titled, "Survival at Sea" lying atop an array of supplies.
SOMEONE takes it out and flips through pages illustrated with diagrams.
Lifting another hatch, the teen finds it packed with life jackets. He takes one out and tosses it to Orange Juice.
The orangutan picks it up, turning it in her hands and feet as she examines it.
Beyond her, SOMEONE digs out several more life jackets.
Orange Juice gives hers a shake, the throws it down.
Later, using ropes and netting, he bundles the life jackets together into a small, makeshift raft.
The life preserver crowns it and three long handled oars criss-cross out from it.
Forming six branch-like spokes.
As SOMEONE struggles to maneuver it into the water,
SOMEONE emerges from the canvas shelter.
Perching atop the zebra's carcass, he starts to take a bite. Orange Juice angrily thumps the rim of the boat.
SOMEONE turns and stalks the orangutan who backs against the canvas' edge.
As SOMEONE lunges, she strikes him down.
As SOMEONE looks on, his jubilant smile fades.
Orange Juice peers down at the hyena, then sits on steadily and faces her human companion.
SOMEONE attacks her.
He drags her down to the floor and tears into her.
SOMEONE climbs over his raft and unsheathes a knife.
The hyena retreats to the boat's stern and cowers.
Our view sweeps down to Orange Juice's body as it grows still.
Blood stains the wood near her throat.
As he stares down at her, SOMEONE's mournful expression hardens wrathfully.
Facing SOMEONE, he swings the knife.
The tiger springs out from the shelter beneath him. Landing on the zebra, SOMEONE kills the hyena with a wrench of his jaws. Behind him, SOMEONE scrambles for his makeshift raft. As he pushes it overboard, the tiger faces him with a snarl.
Standing, SOMEONE picks up the oar.
SOMEONE swats it from his grasp.
As the tiger climbs onto the canvas, SOMEONE curls up in a fetal position with his back to him and squeezes his eyes shut.
SOMEONE backs off, returning his attention to his kill.
SOMEONE leaps from the boat, following a rope, tethering the raft to the lifeboat.
He tries to climb on top of the raft but it rolls under his weight.
Later, the boy persists as the bundle of life jackets loosens and rolls beneath his grasp.
He strikes it angrily.
Later still, he ties the life jacket to the end of an oar spoke, balancing the raft's buoyancy.
A shark swims passed as he works, spotting it.
The boy climbs on top of the raft.
Now SOMEONE lies still beneath the canvas shelter.
At the boat's prow, SOMEONE peaks in at the tiger, he lifts out the duffle of supplies, revealing a sizable stock of canned goods and boxed food beneath.
SOMEONE eagerly climbs in to retrieve them.
Now, perched at the prow of the lifeboat, SOMEONE drinks down the contents of a can.
He fits a plastic lid on top, then drops it into a sack nestled at the center of his makeshift raft.
SOMEONE takes a handful of cans from the supply hatch and drops those in as well.
Taking out small boxes, he chucks one in and opens the other.
Unwrapping a nutritional biscuit, he takes a big bite.
Looking down, he finds a sizable rat scurrying over the cans.
SOMEONE watches it as he eats.
SOMEONE lunges at him.
The tiger halts, his claws sticking in the canvas.
He staggers back, snapping irritably at the fabric as a recoiling SOMEONE watches with wide eyes.
SOMEONE turns his gaze out over the slate-grey water surrounding them.
He walks along the benches lining the boat's perimeter, pausing to paw at the zebra carcass.
With the animal distracted, SOMEONE starts to climb from the prow.
SOMEONE charges forward, his head jetting up from the canvas' open flap at the bow.
His enormous mass knocks SOMEONE onto his back on the canvas and the rat scurries along the cover.
SOMEONE emerges from the opening at the boat's center and climbs partway up on the canvas. The rat climbs up SOMEONE's arm and over his head.
The teen grabs the rodent.
SOMEONE pauses, staring hungrily.
SOMEONE throws the rat at the tiger who catches it in his mouth.
As SOMEONE slurps it down, SOMEONE jumps off the boat, he tries to push away on the raft but finds a line tethering him closely to the boat's prow.
As he tries to release the line, SOMEONE lunges over the prow swiping his massive claws at his head.
SOMEONE ducks and the tiger nearly falls off the boat. Scraping his rear claws against the painted metal hull, the tiger climbs back aboard.
SOMEONE pushes off from the boat on his raft.
SOMEONE returns to the center of the boat as the frightened teen paddles away. Still securely connected by the tether.
Stopping a few yards from the boat, SOMEONE vomits into the water.
At night, a full moon shines through a gap in the clouds. On the boat,
SOMEONE drags the zebra carcass out of view.
From his raft, SOMEONE watches tearfully.
His sits cross-legged, his shoulders hunched.
SOMEONE peers out at him from the edge of the boat, his parted lips showing his long, sharp fangs.
The tiger calmly flops his tail as he observes the boy.
His lips quivering.
SOMEONE regards the tiger woefully.
Thick clouds drift before the enormous full moon.
As the boat and raft float of gently rolling waves, the clouds gradually blot out the moonlight leaving the boy and tiger in darkness.
Now a rising golden sun cuts through the dark.
As it illuminates the sky, we find the boat and raft adrift on perfectly still, glassy waters that reflect the cloudy sky.
As we peer down on them from above,
we find a perfect mirror-like image of the sun-lit clouds, undisturbed on the water's surface.
SOMEONE maintains his cross-legged pose as he watches the boat.
Later he writes.
He uses blank pages in the survival book.
He write with a pencil.
He presses the tip to the paper making a period.
Later, he puts the folded torn out in an empty water can and caps it.
As we watch from a distance.
SOMEONE stands from the center of his raft and throws the can with all his might.
It lands close to us and bobs peacefully in the water.
A birds-eye view shows the can about ten yards from SOMEONE's raft sending out gentle ripples over the current-less sea.
The boy turns, looking over his shoulder.
Tethered a few yards off, the lifeboat appears empty and peaceful.
SOMEONE emerges from the canvas shelter at the center of the boat, steps up on a seat below its rim,
He gazes out over the vast expanse of motion-less sunlit sea.
Watching him calmly, SOMEONE crouches down and takes up the rope tether.
Tugging hand over hand, he reels the boat closer.
At the prow, SOMEONE lifts the end of the canvas cover and peers beneath.
Nestled inside, SOMEONE snarls up at him but makes no move to rise.
The carcasses of the zebra and the hyena flank the predator.
SOMEONE gives a small nod and gazes into the animal's fierce amber eyes.
The teen lowers the flap, then pushes the boat off.
Standing along in the vast, isolated expanse, he turns his gaze toward the sunlit clouds above.
Now a map from the survival book illustrates the world's ocean currents with inter-swirling circles.
Reading it on his bobbing raft, SOMEONE looks over his shoulder.
Now SOMEONE reads through the book and follows its advice.
SOMEONE notices a rash along his side.
Later, he lies back, his hands over his face.
He catches rain in the bucket, his open mouth, and cans in each hand.
SOMEONE collects water puddled on the canvas cover.
Now ten hash marks mar the hull off the prow. SOMEONE carves an eleventh with his knife.
Juxtaposed with the scenes, SOMEONE reads the book.
On an overcast day, he studies the book on his raft.
Pausing, he faces the boat.
SOMEONE uses the canvas cone.
He drags the boat sideways over the waves.
He pulls the boat close.
SOMEONE emerges from his shelter, his ears back and his eyes wide.
Standing on the raft, SOMEONE rocks the boat by its prow.
Blinking his amber eyes, the tiger hangs his head and convulses nauseously.
Gritting his teeth. SOMEONE pushes himself up on the boat's canvas cover.
He plants his feet wide apart and crouches over, getting his balance as he faces the tiger.
He lunges forward, his arms raised and spread. SOMEONE retreats to the boat's stern, sits on the rear seat and leans his face over the water.
SOMEONE watches him with wide eyes then reaches for his pants.
In front of his feet, urine hits the canvas.
Finishing, SOMEONE fiercely points downward.
SOMEONE opens his mouth wide in what appears to be a lazy yawn.
He turns, putting his tail to SOMEONE.
He sprays the teen in the face.
Sputtering, SOMEONE rolls off the canvas and the tiger reclaims it.
Now wearing the sea anchor as a hat that shades his face, neck and shoulders,
SOMEONE reels in a floating beach ball-sized device shaped like a chocolate kiss.
It collects dew.
Harvesting a plastic sack of fresh water, SOMEONE drinks through a straw.
He pours the rest into the bucket.
Later, he hefts the bucket into the lifeboat, setting it on the seat at the stern.
He raises the whistle to his lips.
The tiger emerges from his shelter.
SOMEONE pushes off as SOMEONE approaches the bucket.
The tiger bats it gently, sniffs it, and sticks his face in.
He writes in the survival book.
He baits a fishing hook with chewed biscuit then lowers it into the water.
From the lifeboat, SOMEONE licks his chops as he looks on.

Now, a vast field of golden barley wavers gently in a breeze. Standing among the healthy crops, SOMEONE plucks a grain from one of the wispy stalks. He bites a seed, examines it and casts a hopeful gaze toward the sunny sky.
He strolls happily through the barley. Reaching a light blue tractor, he climbs into

SOMEONE hauls a bucket through the muddy work yard.
The limousine drives past the yard. The three siblings stare.
In unison, the three dash toward the arriving car, short-cutting through the barn.
Now, one of the chauffeur's polished leather shoes steps from the limousine, but halts mid-stride above the mud. He gives in and steps down.
SOMEONE lowers a newspaper.
SOMEONE opens his door.
SOMEONE makes a wild face at her.
In yellow checked knickerbockers, SOMEONE leans foppishly on the car.

SOMEONE halts at one of the muddy boxes.
He runs after the others. Now at the shop.
The old woman licks her fingers.
She walks away from an apothecary cabinet.
Mrs. SOMEONE enters an adjoining room and shuts the door behind her. Stepping behind the counter, SOMEONE finds syrup dripping from the cabinet drawers, pooling on the floor. Her handbag and green overcoat drop from her grip, landing in the mess. A higher drawer slides open, leaking more syrup.
SOMEONE lifts a foot. Gooey syrup trails stringily from her shoe.
She checks the drawers.

The bird moves to the floor in front of her.
Hanging his head, the bird trudges away. SOMEONE SOMEONE squints and
taps her stick. Sparks spray from it and the kids unfreeze. They stare at SOMEONE.
As she eyes them firmly, the parlor door opens behind her.
She steps aside. As SOMEONE and his sister rise from the floor, SOMEONE straightens his tie. The kids file out of the parlor past SOMEONE.
SOMEONE blinks disbelievingly at the well-behaved group.
She watches as they head upstairs.
In the parlor.
She hands him the letters. Glancing at her, he smiles faintly, then turns back to face the room. He finds the elegant dishware unbroken on the table.
The candy dish sits by, perfectly intact. The unharmed tractor drawing rests on a shelf.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze to a bench seat against a wall. Toting the cricket bat, he heads over and places the letters on the sill above the seat back. His eyes take in SOMEONE as he walks back to her. He hands her the bat.
As SOMEONE leaves the parlor, the mole above SOMEONE's upper lip disappears.
She eyes Mr. Edelweiss.
She looks at a window which opened.
As she strides out of the room, Mr. Edelweiss obeys. Now, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in the kitchen.
SOMEONE tilts her head.
She leans the bat on the stair rail.
In a disheveled attic bedroom, a miniature carousel spins.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE cower as SOMEONE enters. SOMEONE and his sister scoot back on their beds.
SOMEONE stares stoically, her snaggletooth pressing into her lower lip. She produces her walking stick from inside her frock and raises it. In the kitchen, SOMEONE sets a teakettle on the stove.
SOMEONE rubs her eyes.
At a second look, she finds the staircase as plain as ever. She collects a teapot from the kitchen table and turns her attention to the sink. The front door behind her opens and a goat steps inside. With her back to the animal, SOMEONE washes dishes. As the goat creeps to the stairs, SOMEONE sniffs the air. So does the goat.
SOMEONE resumes her work. The goat hurries upstairs. It disappears around the corner just as SOMEONE turns. She sets the now clean teapot on the table, then turns her back to the door again and smooths a clock at a sideboard. As she arranges a setting on a tray, a cow enters the house. Geraldine glances at the oblivious woman, then hooves her way upstairs.
to the sink, a baby elephant enters the house.
She shields the elephant from SOMEONE.
SOMEONE turns.
The elephant nudges SOMEONE with its trunk.
As SOMEONE turns away, SOMEONE directs the elephant up the stairs with a friendly pat on its rear.
SOMEONE starts for the door. SOMEONE emerges from the pantry.
SOMEONE beams. SOMEONE produces a lantern.
The door shuts.
The SOMEONE gazes at the children's window.
The dark hairy mole on SOMEONE's chin vanishes.
SOMEONE skulks past a gatepost and nearly bumps into her.
She brushes past him and strolls off with her lantern.
SOMEONE's gaze darts. He hunches low and sneaks onto the farm proper toting a shovel. The saboteur freezes warily then trots on. Now curtains drawn over the children's bedroom window flutter. We glide through them and inside. At the foot of the nearest bed, a carousel night light glows softly. A lamp at the head of the bed illuminates the girls sleeping toe-to-toe under the covers next to Geraldine who snores.
In the next bed over, the goat sleeps with his head on a pillow next to
SOMEONE's slumbering face and SOMEONE sleeps with his head at the foot of the bed. Like the girls and cow, all three share a single blanket. Across the room, SOMEONE sleeps by the baby elephant.
SOMEONE's trunk steals SOMEONE's half of the covers. The chilly boy curls up. Now framed photos show SOMEONE and Rory on their wedding day and Rory playing cricket. In bed, SOMEONE reads a worn letter, then sniffs a dried flower folded inside. She presses the letter to her lips.
Outside, by the side of the barn he digs a hole.

and sticks his head into the hole. He braces himself with both arms as he walks his legs up the side of the barn and eases deeper inside.
Outside, SOMEONE gets stuck up to his chest. 
His feet flail in the air, they flop over and he pulls himself out.
As he stands to walk away, one of his feet slips into the hole and he falls flat.
He scrambles up.
He glances at the house as another pig follows.
Another piglet trots off. Daytime. A rooster perches on the hood of the tractor. Now in the children's room, SOMEONE's shadow passes over their sleeping forms. The animals are gone.
As she leaves, SOMEONE peeks under his covers.
The children join them. SOMEONE marches downstairs in purple pajamas and a full-face gas mask with a single snout-like filter. He eyes SOMEONE suspiciously as she cooks, then strides to a seat at the head of the table. SOMEONE stares at his headgear and cocks her head.
SOMEONE serves breakfast.
SOMEONE hurries into SOMEONE's room and opens the wardrobe. She rifles through floral sundresses hanging inside.
Back in the kitchen.
SOMEONE rushes out.
The pane falls inward and shatters.
Later, he flies to a fence and burps.
He soars into the barn. SOMEONE knits her brow and follows him inside.
She peeks into the hole.
Now inside, SOMEONE repairs the window.
She smooths putty at the seam.
SOMEONE mouths Ew, affecting a mock fearful expression.
SOMEONE descends the stairs in a flowing white gown of layered tulle. She wears a silky veil.
She studies the dress. Outside, SOMEONE carries a bucket into the barn.
He finds the pigpen empty. In the kitchen.
She lifts her brow and raises her stick, then leans it gently against the table.
SOMEONE blinks thoughtfully, then doffs his mask.
He storms out after his cousins. SOMEONE lingers on the staircase landing. SOMEONE summons a breath, picks up her gnarled walking stick, and faces the girl. The SOMEONE looks from the open door to SOMEONE.

She bangs her walking stick on the ground, creating sparks. At the tree, the piglet runs up the trunk.

hops to the cart. Now all five children meet on a hilltop. The pigs race away through a meadow.
SOMEONE draws in the dirt. Later, apples lie on a wooded road. SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit astride a branch above, holding SOMEONE's veil.
The girls perch high on the road shoulder. SOMEONE cups his hands.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold the veil between them. Under the branch, the piglets barrel down the road toward them. SOMEONE runs after them, driving them along, holding his safari hat in place with one hand.

the animals gallop by.

Noticing SOMEONE, she straightens and frowns.
SOMEONE stares at the girl with a furrowed brow.
SOMEONE returns the torn filthy veil wadded up in a ball.
As SOMEONE stares at it, SOMEONE remorsefully hangs her head.
SOMEONE observes.
Her unibrow vanishes. She catches a piglet watching her. SOMEONE winks and the animal winks back. She puts a shushing finger to her lips and the piglet joins its siblings. Farmer SOMEONE watches with a puzzled frown.
As the cart leaves, two piglets peer over the back gate.
SOMEONE tilts her head.
SOMEONE turns. The limousine approaches.
Running to the car, she opens the passenger door and finds the backseat empty. SOMEONE shuts the door with a wounded gaze. SOMEONE looks on sympathetically as his sister faces SOMEONE.
Her brother glances toward their cousins.
The chauffeur meets her gaze.
SOMEONE holds out a shoebox of SOMEONE's egg blue marked with a scallop-shell logo. SOMEONE slowly takes it from him.
Under SOMEONE's compassionate gaze, SOMEONE hangs her head then steps away.
The chauffeur sadly faces forward.
The city girl marches out through the farm gate, biting her rosy lips in a suppressed sob.
SOMEONE follows his sister. Heading into a lush green field, SOMEONE chucks the shoebox to the ground. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare after their unhappy cousins, then turn away and head toward the barn. SOMEONE observes the children, then shifts her thoughtful gaze.
Above, clouds drift across a violet sky. Later, SOMEONE sits dejectedly on the edge of SOMEONE's bed. The farm girl enters with the shoebox and sets it down beside her cousin.
SOMEONE shrugs. Sitting by her, SOMEONE puts the box on her own lap. She admiringly sets the lid aside, reaches into the rosy tissue paper, and pulls out a graceful pale pink slipper. It bears an ankle strap at the back and a pale pink bow and rhinestone buckle on the closed toe.
The farm girl faces her cousin and finds her expression sincere. She puts the shoe back in the box, sets it aside, and goes to a trunk at the foot of her bed. SOMEONE cranes her neck to watch. SOMEONE pulls out some brown velveteen pants and a crisp white blouse, both neatly folded.
She lays them beside SOMEONE, then sits and returns the shoebox to her lap. With a faint smile, the city girl picks up the dainty blouse which bears small blue toned polka dots. She holds it to her chest and smiles. SOMEONE lays it aside and regards the velveteen. Our view dips to a pair of hands scrubbing filthy fabric. At a bathtub, SOMEONE massages lather into her wedding veil, bites her lips, then checks the rinsed cloth. It bears a one-inch hole. In a gold-tinged flashback, a modest carriage stands adorned with sunflowers, roses, and a Just Married sign. In the driver's seat, a handsome man in a black jacket and a boutonniere made of barley sprigs beams at his bride, SOMEONE. A wreath of flowers holds her snowy veil upon her head. As we glimpse SOMEONE eyeing the ruined veil, she remembers laughing merrily with her groom. They stand in the mud. He in his boots and she, luxuriantly, dipping in her bare foot. Rory scoops SOMEONE into his arms. They share a loving kiss and he carries her toward the house. She clings to him, holding her shoes and wedding bouquet. Back in the present, SOMEONE hangs the tattered veil on a clothesline. As it flutters in a breeze, our view of its SOMEONE trim blurs.

Mrs. SOMEONE gazes sadly as SOMEONE hikes toward them.
SOMEONE glances at the old woman, who swallows hard.
SOMEONE's joyful smile fades slightly. Standing apart, SOMEONE steps forward. SOMEONE faces SOMEONE and the children.
He holds the envelope out to his sister-in-law. She accepts it bravely, turns it over in her graceful hands, and musters a smile.
SOMEONE looks away. SOMEONE faces Mrs. SOMEONE.
The old woman nods. As SOMEONE turns away, Mrs. SOMEONE's brow furrows compassionately. Her lips pressed into a brisk smile, SOMEONE opens the envelope. SOMEONE's chest heaves. As his mother reads the telegram, her smile vanishes.
She sinks to the ground. SOMEONE takes the message.
SOMEONE sits close to SOMEONE as his older siblings read.
SOMEONE drops his full glass of ginger beer and SOMEONE collapses behind their mother. SOMEONE bows her head. As SOMEONE listlessly steps away, SOMEONE crouches before SOMEONE and the Docherty's draw near.
The husband reaches for SOMEONE, but his wife tactfully restrains him. SOMEONE continues through the field, leaving the others behind. As SOMEONE stares off with heartbroken gaze, SOMEONE clutches her hand in both of his.
Now the sun shines cheerily on the barn. Inside, SOMEONE sits slumped on the Scratch-o-matic seat. He takes a ragged breath. Watching him from the doorway, SOMEONE meekly shifts on his feet.
SOMEONE turns to face him. His gaze solemn, SOMEONE steps up alongside him.
He looks up, admiring the Scratch-o-matic.

SOMEONE dismounts and waits as SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb out of the sidecar.
Both boys wear suits. SOMEONE's is blue gray and SOMEONE's is checked with a purple necktie. They eye the towering building, then stride toward it.
Black boots block their way. The boys sweep their eyes up the red coat of a barrel chested guard in a tall bearskin hat.
SOMEONE mouths, Tell him, to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE's lips stutter.
SOMEONE wears a military uniform and

The boys exchange a look.

Sergeant Jeffreys uneasily shifts his gaze.
She gives a nod. Sergeant Jeffreys smiles.
Grinning, the boys follow the sergeant as he marches past sand bag barricades through a doorway. The boys glance back at SOMEONE, garbed once again in her black dress. She knowingly touches the side of her nose. Sergeant Jeffreys leads SOMEONE and SOMEONE down a corridor to an elevator where they ride to the 100th floor. On the top floor, they pass military strategists who position model planes, ships, and tanks on a table map as big as eight king size beds.
Back on the farm. The girls find SOMEONE and SOMEONE in the kitchen.
Leafs through the contract.
Back at the War Office, SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk side by side down a narrow red carpet.
At the end of a long room, the carpet spreads into a square underneath a wide desk. A mustached man in a military uniform stands behind it. As the boys stop in front of his desk, he stares down at them with stern eyes.
Lord SOMEONE's eyes widen at SOMEONE. He sets his glasses down on his desk, then steps out from behind it. With his arms crossed at his back, he regards the boys frankly.
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a nod.
Lord SOMEONE listens.
SOMEONE presses his lips tightly.
Licking his lips, SOMEONE lowers his gaze.
Lord SOMEONE closes the distance between them and glares at SOMEONE.
SOMEONE glances at his cousin's anguished face.
Lord SOMEONE stares, his reddened face almost queasy.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze from SOMEONE to Lord SOMEONE. The man looks into his nephew's unwavering eyes, then opens his mouth to speak. His lips stutter.
With an embarrassed look, he turns away.
The boys watch as he walks back behind his desk and straightens his tie. Lord SOMEONE stares downward, picks up his glasses, then lifts his gaze thoughtfully to the boys before him.
As he trudges out of the room, SOMEONE rests a hand on SOMEONE's shoulder. At the farmhouse, SOMEONE clutches a pen in his hands as he hovers over SOMEONE, watching her review the contract.
As he leans over her shoulder, the fountain pen poised, SOMEONE gives him a look.
SOMEONE yanks the pen from SOMEONE, then continues reading. SOMEONE steps up onto a chair.
Glancing at him, SOMEONE stomps to the chair. She kneels and peeks underneath.
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a puzzled look, but
SOMEONE grabs it and stows it in her tool belt.
SOMEONE leans against a wall.
SOMEONE nods sadly. He swallows hard.
SOMEONE hangs his head.
The boys look to the door where an officer enters with Lord SOMEONE. The officer gathers a long strip of ticker tape as it trails behind him. Lord SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE averts his heartbroken gaze, then furrows his brow.
It's Lord SOMEONE.
SOMEONE releases him, then turns to SOMEONE.
They start to run.
The boys stop by the door. With a tender look, Lord SOMEONE strides down the narrow red carpet, his eyes on his son. He faces SOMEONE and takes a breath. The boy holds his father's gaze.
Cyril's lips purse into an uncertain smirk. His father flashes a hint of a smile, then nods.
Lord SOMEONE allows his smile through.
He shakes SOMEONE's hand.
With a nod, SOMEONE releases his father's hand and turns away. Lord SOMEONE watches the boy shoot him a final glance, then exit the room.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE hurry through the War Office building.

SOMEONE rolls her eyes. Back at the farm, SOMEONE sits alone in the barn and watches some chickens. The baby elephant appears behind him and taps him with its trunk.
The elephant curls its trunk, then extends it.
SOMEONE sets two pens beside SOMEONE who holds her head as she reads the papers.
There's a third pen on the contract for SOMEONE. The elephant's trunk sneaks up from under the table and steals it.
SOMEONE reaches for his pen, but it's gone. He pats the table.

SOMEONE and SOMEONE stifle their grins as SOMEONE searches under the table. They see the elephant leaving.
SOMEONE sees him off.
SOMEONE's head rises from behind the tabletop as he straightens and eyes SOMEONE. With a dry look, he brushes his bangs out of his face. Now SOMEONE's motorcycle speeds down the road.
In the sidecar, SOMEONE glances at his wristwatch.

SOMEONE sadly eyes her daughter as SOMEONE stands and uncaps the pen.
SOMEONE holds her gaze.
He puts the pen in her hand and she pushes him away.
SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE aside.
They watch with terrified looks.
Outside, an enemy plane soars in the sky.
Below, in the house, SOMEONE starts to sign the deed.
As he sneezes, the pilot's head bobs, dropping dangerously close to a red control button. SOMEONE finishes writing her first name.
The nose hits the button and it lights up.
SOMEONE's pen bumps the paper too hard and spills ink on the deed. She and the kids rush to the window.

She leaves him.
Now in the barley field, the bomb stands lodged, nose first in the ground. Mr. SOMEONE stands on a ladder over its steaming tail vent. As he refers to his manual, he spots the others on the field's edge.
Mr. Edelweiss lands atop a quaint Vardo styled wagon. As Mr. SOMEONE peers into the bomb's tail, his eyes widen. He swings backward and the ladder tips.
SOMEONE races towards the bomb.
SOMEONE chases the kids.
In the house without a chair, SOMEONE balances on one foot, crosses the other over as if sitting, and props an elbow on his crooked knee.
He releases the pose.
He grimaces.
Outside, SOMEONE stands on the ladder and peers through a circular opening in the bomb that has louvers like a window shutter.
SOMEONE removes the circular vent. She tosses it.
SOMEONE removes a pair of scissors from her tool belt. Peering into the vent, she tries to work the scissor blades past the protective metal spiral coiled around the wire. They won't fit. The others watch nervously.
As everyone searches their pockets, SOMEONE's face lights up.
She takes out a manicure case and removes a pair of nail scissors.
She hands them to SOMEONE, who grins, then passes them up the ladder to SOMEONE. SOMEONE receives the scissors and inspects them.
SOMEONE gives a relieved nod. SOMEONE reaches through the bomb's vent and works the scissors between two of the coils. She snips the wire.
He frees up a hand and grabs a shaker off the table to season his eggs. He dips a finger in for a taste, then moves a pan onto a burner and pours the eggs in.
Miss SOMEONE and Miss SOMEONE stand behind him.
They wear candy striper uniforms. Outside by the bomb.
SOMEONE leans into the bomb, her arms stretching toward the wire. The tip of her scissors stop a few inches away.
She keeps trying. As SOMEONE bites a knuckle, SOMEONE waits anxiously. Mrs. SOMEONE startles them.
She glances at SOMEONE. The kids return their attention to SOMEONE, who leans down into the vent and stretches her arms toward the red wire. Her scissor blades close around it and she snips through. She straightens and looks at the others.
A large blonde woman shows a stuffed and mounted owl.
She has a doll sized replica of SOMEONE.

SOMEONE eyes him.
She lifts her chin.
The others flee.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE pull an IV bottle of pink fluid from their medical bag. SOMEONE jerks against his handcuffs.
Inside, the boys and SOMEONE peek out from behind the wagon, as Mr. Edelweiss, now enormously round like a balloon, descend to SOMEONE. The girls take cover behind a trough with Mr. SOMEONE. SOMEONE catches the bird, points him in a new direction, and releases him.
He floats high, flapping his wings which appear puny compared to his inflated body. SOMEONE watches with an awestruck gaze.
SOMEONE raises her walking stick.
In the kitchen. The windows burst open.
She seizes a banister.
The door swings shut.
As the wind dies down, SOMEONE descends safely to the floor.
He sits on the stove.

Snowflakes. The children hold up their hands and Mrs. SOMEONE tried
catching some in her open handbag.
Turning on the spot, SOMEONE stops, facing the field and stares.
The SOMEONE's follow his gaze. Their mouths agape.
Our view sweeps out to the field where SOMEONE stands among a vast and tidy arrangement of the baled and bundled crops.
SOMEONE returns.
The slide leans on a hay bale.
Smiling, SOMEONE follows the others out to the slide. Mrs. SOMEONE lags behind with a bittersweet gaze.
SOMEONE slides down the tin chute.
SOMEONE takes the next turn, followed by Mr. SOMEONE.
SOMEONE joins SOMEONE.
SOMEONE blinks wistfully.
She tenderly faces Mrs. SOMEONE with her snaggletooth smile.
The two share a warm smile and hug. SOMEONE peers toward the children, then steps away. Mrs. SOMEONE gazes after her tearfully, then faces the children with a sobbing breath. Now atop the hay bale, SOMEONE discovers the Medal for Resolve pinned to her overalls. SOMEONE wears the Medal for Kindness.
SOMEONE has one too. As SOMEONE cherishes the Leaps of Faith Medal, SOMEONE admires yet another.
SOMEONE points.
Shading his eyes, SOMEONE spots her halfway across the field.
Mr. Edelweiss takes flight.
SOMEONE's got a medal too.
SOMEONE and the kids run off.
Mr. SOMEONE steps up beside his wife.
up the wooded road, SOMEONE leads the chase after her.
Leaving the woods, SOMEONE rounds a turn, stops running and stares. She steps forward. Her eyes wide.
The children catch up to her.
Taking in her emotional smile, they follow her gaze. Atop a distant ridge, SOMEONE swaps cordial bows with Rory.
He drops a duffle bag. With one arm in a sling, he raises the other in a wave and runs forward.
The kids dash out to meet him.
SOMEONE beams as her husband races to their children, his face illuminated by his warm toothy grin. Leading the others, SOMEONE flings his arms around his father who scoops him up and spins him around.

He kisses the boy's neck. SOMEONE joyfully strolls up to join them. Setting SOMEONE down, Rory straightens and meets her

The two cling to each other in a fast embrace, then draw SOMEONE, SOMEONE
SOMEONE and SOMEONE
Facing them, Rory warmly extends a hand to his nephew.
Her snaggletooth gone from her lovely face,
a warm smile brightens her pleasing features.
As the reunited family heads down hill, SOMEONE finds Mr. Edelweiss perched by her side.
She pets her shoulder.
He jumps up and down happily, then alights upon her shoulder. SOMEONE beams at the bird, then turns her back to us and strolls toward a gentle valley.
Back on the other side of the grassy ridge, wild flowers blanket the field between us and the distant SOMEONE. Silhouetted against the sunny sky, the magical woman slowly descends out of view. Cut to black. Words appear. The end. SOMEONE's silhouette appears in profile above them.
The figure taps her walking stick. We drift into the silhouette and find a cartoon where SOMEONE pedals the Scratch-o- matic
The meters needle jumps to
Our gaze flies along the contraption to three brushes, each scratching a piglet.
Five children peek out from her skirt, then tumble out and frolic away.

SOMEONE struggles to balance on a teeter-totter as she juggles the children. SOMEONE Gyllenhaal. Two piglets fly through the air using their floppy ears
He lands in a puddle as the children mirthfully look on. Mr. SOMEONE takes him away in handcuffs. Now the shop drawer open and close by themselves. Mr. Edelweiss peeks out from one.

Holloway eyes a display monitor. It shows a structure peeking out from behind a mountain.
He gets up.
He peers out a window.
Clearing the gateway, the ship turns towards a low structure built in the distant valley.
The ship's jets rotate downward.
They slow the ships descent to a controlled pace.
The jets bring up massive clouds of dust around the ship as it touches down.
Overhead, the enormous ringed planet glows softly beside the sun.
Domes resembling the tops of beehives surrounded by stone walls dot the valley in single file.
Roughly a mile apart from each other.
On board SOMEONE, Holloway rushes to the front windows, while SOMEONE follows warily.
Other members of the crew move forward, staring out.
Holloway kisses SOMEONE's head.
Now the survey team suits up.
Beneath their clear helmets, skullcaps bear their names. The Scottish woman bears the name SOMEONE.
SOMEONE notices a crewmen wielding a flame-thrower.
In a suit, Holloway presses buttons on his sleeve.
A large boxy chamber descends from the ships underside.
In the airlock, a hatch rises. The crew steps into a hanger.
SOMEONE brings a duffel to the front of a transport vehicle with twin rows of seats.
As the mohawked man sits, SOMEONE takes the seat facing him.
The mohawked man moves down a few spots.
The hanger hatch lowers making an exit ramp.
The transport pulls out alongside two ATVs.
In the transport, Holloway moves close to SOMEONE.
Holloway chuckles.
He presses her helmet to his with an ardent gaze, then turns away.
SOMEONE adverts her troubled gaze.
The transport leads the two ATVs to an opening in a wall surrounding the structure.
A sharp crust tops the beehive like doom.
Holloway and SOMEONE come forward, crowding the front of the cabin with SOMEONE as they stare out the windshield.
The crust rounded front gives a hint of wind-eroded carving of a face.
The survey vehicles pull up around the dome and park.
A side hatch in the transport rises and SOMEONE leads the others out.
Her helmet's computerized view shows long, low entrances carved into the dome's base.
In the dark cockpit, SOMEONE stands behind the captain's chair.
The other survey team members leave the ATVs staring up.
Holloway ventures forward and SOMEONE follows.
The team members approach one of the entry ways, each carrying a kit or bag of varying size.
We peer up at the approaching humans from a sandy slope dotted with sharp rocks.
Crossing the threshold, they head down the slope.
SOMEONE regards the space with a calm expression.
A view through a helmet camera shows a few of the team exploring the cavernous space.
Various readings border the image along with the user's name, SOMEONE.
Now, Holloway's view closes in on a cave opening.
As the team ventures in, holographic monitors each show the captain a crew member's computerized helmet view.
Venturing through the opening.
SOMEONE draws himself up with an alert stare.
SOMEONE follows.
On the other side, SOMEONE and the mohawked man linger, sharing an uneasy gaze.
SOMEONE ducks through first.
The other man glances fearfully over his shoulder.
Further in, the team passes through a circular archway
and enters a tunnel perpendicular to their path.
They pause, shining their lights in either direction.
The mohawked man readies orbs.
SOMEONE releases two into the air. Spinning, they shine red scanner beams in all directions as they fly down the corridor.
He sends two more off the other way.
The last scanning pup vanishes around a turn.
Leaving his chair the captain goes to a layout table.
As he activates its computerized system, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE join him.
In the 3-D holograph flying red beacons map out a tunnel system.
Yellow beacons marked with surname initials SOMEONE the team member's locations. The pups split off again as the extending network of tunnels grows more complex.
The survey team reaches a rounded tunnel of dark gleaming stone.
As he leads them on, SOMEONE curiously shines her flashlight at the etched stone walls.
SOMEONE takes up the rear, closely observing his surroundings.
They venture towards a faint light in the distance.
Now, beams of light sweep erratically over rock.
Rounding a turn, the survey team steps into view and slows.
The stand in a chamber where water streams to around pit at its center.
A pup doubles back from the far wall and drops down the pit.
Water rains around the probe as it plunges several stories.
Holloway taps keys on his sleeve.
Holloway unlatches his helmet then bends over and pulls it off. Straightening he inhales deeply and pulls off his skullcap.
His breath clouds the air.
SOMEONE smiles.
Glaring scoldingly at Holloway, SOMEONE removes her helmet.
In the cockpit.
The away team moves through a dark space.
Hiking a tunnel, they sweep flashlights over their surroundings.
Trailing behind, SOMEONE spots a panel with carved dots and lines high up on the wall.
Climbing up, he notices greenish slime dripping from a few of the engraved points.
SOMEONE collects some on his gloved fingertip,
then presses it to his thumb.
As they part, the slime stretches between his fingertips.
Glowing blue particles swarm within.
SOMEONE sniffs it.
Unnoticing the others venture ahead without him.
SOMEONE runs his finger along a few of the lines and presses the engraved dots.
They light up beneath his touch.
A screen of glowing blue particles forms and races down the tunnel.
Pausing, the human team members turn.
He stares at an approaching light.
Glowing blue particles form several giant humanoids racing down the tunnel.
As SOMEONE remains in their path, they wash over him like wind.
Holloway sweeps SOMEONE out of their way. The incorporeal figures continue down the tunnel.
The team runs after the giant ghostly figures.
Lagging behind the others, a lone apparition stumbles and falls. It gets up and runs on as those ahead dart out of view.
Holloway and SOMEONE arrive in time to watch it collapse at a doorway. It's ghostly hatch lowers on top of him and he vanishes.
Staying SOMEONE with a hand, Holloway ventures forward. The others arrive behind him.
A body lies at the door.
The team approaches it.
At the door, Holloway and SOMEONE spy ancient text carved into the stone.
The strange characters fill several rows.
SOMEONE starts to leave.
He marches back indignantly.
Leaning close to SOMEONE, SOMEONE wheels around and leaves with SOMEONE.
Now, as Holloway, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE examine the decapitated body,
SOMEONE climbs a ladder.
Holloway hands over a flashlight sized device.
As SOMEONE studies the carved symbols in the wall, SOMEONE inserts a probe from the carbon reader into the alien being.
SOMEONE taps the symbols, which light up briefly with his touch.
As a pup moves in to scan the revealed chamber, SOMEONE kneels just on the other side of the door.
Her flashlight beam reveals a head, three times the size of a human's with a short elephant like trunk.
Holloway moves further inside transfixed by an enormous humanoid bust.
SOMEONE steps further in, studying the sculpted face.
the sculpture towers over hundreds of sleek gray thigh high urns.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE follow the others into the room.
One of their boots lifts from the soft dirt revealing worms wriggling about.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE aim their flashlights at the curved ceiling.
Holloway moves deeper in through the evenly spaced urns.
SOMEONE crouches down for a better look at one and reaches out to it.
Condensation beads on its flat topped metallic surface.
As SOMEONE gazes slack-jawed at the humanoid statue.
Holloway continues on around to a recess behind it.
A relief of snake-like creatures surrounding a central humanoid figure adorns the wall.
As Holloway steps around a large pedestal,
his flashlight beam shines through a huge emerald-like stone jutting from its center.
SOMEONE kneels at another urn.
A tar-like substance oozes on top.
The android tilts his head curiously and touches some spilling down the side with a gloved finger.
SOMEONE moves her flashlight beam across the high ceiling.
The painting changes.
The woman rushed back to the severed head.
On the surface, storm clouds swirl menacingly in the sky.
On board SOMEONE, SOMEONE studies images of the storm on a monitor.
In the chamber, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lift the head into a plastic bag.
SOMEONE turns to watch SOMEONE leave the bridge.
Kneeling at a clean urn, SOMEONE sprays it with a gaseous substance from a small canister.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hoist the head up between them.
Holloway leaves the carved relief in the wall. SOMEONE surreptitiously packs the urn in a canvas bag.
As he walks away the black ooze pools around the urn.
The worms wriggle in it.
Outside the dome the four researchers find only the ATVs.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE get in one.
Holloway drives off with SOMEONE on the second ATV.
A dark shadow passes over them. Above, thick black clouds engulf the dome and the enormous carved skull on its crest.
On the road leading towards SOMEONE, the ATVs travel in the dusty wake of a transport.
As the storm engulfs us, jagged shards whip around then block out our view of the fleeing vehicles.
From a long distance, the storm appears as a swiftly moving wall of roiling dirt. On SOMEONE, SOMEONE watches the approaching vehicles and storm.
The transport makes it into the hanger. As the ATVs speed in, one hits a bump and the bagged head falls off.
SOMEONE races after it.
As SOMEONE grabs it, the silica storm knocks her 50 yards into one of the ships towering landing struts. Holloway takes an ATV.
On the screen SOMEONE watches Holloway leave the ship.
The hatch closes, Holloway reaches SOMEONE.
As Holloway climbs out of the vehicle, it blows away.
The ATV tumbles through the storm.
As they take each other's hands amid the whirling shards, an outer door opens on the ship.
SOMEONE clips himself to a cable attached to SOMEONE. Meanwhile the storm lifts SOMEONE.
Holloway struggles to keep a hold on her. As SOMEONE steps out, the storm bounces him around. He makes it over to Holloway and helps him pull SOMEONE back into a recess made by the forked landing strut.
The android calmly clips the humans to his line and gives SOMEONE the okay hand signal.
He lifts a remote control and the line pulls them back towards the open door in the ship.
The clustered trio bobs and bounces as the line carries them through the harsh wind and flying shards. A crew member helps pull them on board.
Later as they move through the hanger, a crew member blasts the floor with a flame thrower.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk through a dark tunnel.
The two trapped men move on through the dark cramped space. Meanwhile, in a lab on board SOMEONE, the head SOMEONE collected rises into a glass chamber. A white mist blasts it, filling the chamber and an image appears on a monitor.
As the head slides from the chamber, SOMEONE arrives.
SOMEONE activates an arched scanner that glides over the head.
As SOMEONE studies one monitor, SOMEONE steps over the image of the head on another.
As Holloway plops down nearby with a bottle of liquor,
SOMEONE easily releases the helmet, lifting the trunk like snout.
Carefully lifting the large helmet off completely, he reveals a human-like head.
It's eyes closed peacefully.
Scaly patches and bumps mar the gray skin on its bald head.
As the others stare, SOMEONE and SOMEONE look more closely.
SOMEONE activates a probe.
She inserts it behind the engineer's ear, taps a few commands on a tablet, and waits.
Holloway lowers his drink as the cells on the engineer's head change.
The engineer's eyes twitch and open slightly.
Dark fluid oozes from small holes on either side of his brow and he grimaces painfully.
As SOMEONE activates a conveyor belt, carrying the head back to the containment chamber,
the engineer's face grimaces and winces. The chamber door slides shut and another shot of white mist blast it.
As the mist clears, the top of the head explodes, splattering the chamber walls with a greenish slime.
SOMEONE lowers her white doctor's mask, SOMEONE stares.
Holloway takes a swig from a bottle and hops down his perch on a counter.
SOMEONE glances after him then lowers her gaze.
Later, the storm continues to pelt SOMEONE. Inside SOMEONE stands by a sleep pod.
He wears the helmet with the glowing visor.
He allows a slight smile and bows his head.
Stepping over to the head of the sleep pod,
SOMEONE touches his palm to its top and a light glowing within dims.
He removes his helmet and amber visor, revealing his stoic expression.
Now, as he strides down a corridor,
he removes gloves and tosses them into a bin.
Rounding a bend, He finds SOMEONE waiting for him.
She steps before him and he slows to a stop.
She steps closer, fixing him with a piercing stare.
As SOMEONE tries to side step around her, she blocks him.
They stare at each other only a few inches apart.
She pins him to a wall.
Tensing her jaw, SOMEONE takes a deep breath through her nose and moves her hand towards SOMEONE's mouth as if to smother him.
She storms away.
SOMEONE approaches a wall of glass-doored coolers filled with supplies. Opening one,
he removes the urn he took from the inner chamber.
In the lab, SOMEONE peers through a microscope.
In the other lab, SOMEONE gently twists the top off the urn and sets it aside.
Meanwhile, with SOMEONE, a green laser beam aims at a slide.
On screen, a map of the engineer's DNA overlaps a human sample. The scientist's jaws drop.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE lifts a rack of four large vials from the urn.
Gray ooze drips off the container as he sets it down on a work surface.
The android breaks off one of the translucent, foot long vials.
As he tips it upside down
black matter collected at the bottom drips downward.
In the lab, SOMEONE peers at the monitor.
Now SOMEONE breaks off the tip of the vial.
Putting his fingertip over the resulting hole, he tips it upside down.
A tiny drop of the black matter sits on the tip of his index finger.
He lifts it to eye level and peers closely at it.
He smiles.
Now, SOMEONE enters the mess hall with a bottle of liquor and sees Holloway drunkenly fiddling with balls on the pool table.
The android lifts a glass off a shelf with his thumb and middle finger, leaving his index finger extended.
Holloway rolls a ball toward him.
Holloway shoves back his hood.
SOMEONE stares grimly at Holloway.
Holloway smiles up at him.
Keeping his index finger extended, SOMEONE pours a glass of liquor.
As he hands it over to Holloway, he dips his index finger in it.
Holloway takes it with a grin.
He takes a sip, then knocks the whole thing back.
SOMEONE smiles.
Meanwhile, in the tunnels, SOMEONE and SOMEONE come upon a pile of corpses.
Their flashlights illuminate the mangled mass over 10 feet tall.
Meanwhile, on the bridge, the holographic map shows the pups still tracing out tunnels and chambers and SOMEONE's and SOMEONE's location within.
SOMEONE stops playing a concertina and approaches a pinging red dot on the map.
The pinging probe sits motionless at what appears to be a dead end.
In the tunnel, SOMEONE peers at the map with narrowed eyes.
Watching video of the holographs in her quarters, SOMEONE speaks into a recorder.
Holloway enters.
He sets the rose in a tumbler before here.
Sitting on his lap she kisses him.
On a small handheld computer
SOMEONE brings up brings up the matching DNA graphs then hands it over to him.
She leans over and hugs him from behind with a giddy smile.
She flops down on a bed.
SOMEONE blinks back tears and shakes her head.
SOMEONE adverts her wounded gaze.
He tackles her affectionately.
He kisses her.
Gazing into her eyes he gives her a tender kiss and rubs her chest.
SOMEONE caresses his cheek then returns the kiss.
He leans in and they embrace with mounting passion.
Reaching down, SOMEONE pulls Holloway's shirt up his torso, revealing his toned sun-kissed back.
He straightens and she yanks it off impatiently.
Holloway leans down again and kisses her hungrily.
Now in a slinky black turtleneck and low ponytail, SOMEONE meanders into the cockpit.
Above the layout table, the probe beacons add additional detail to the now enormous map of the structure.
Two yellow beacons SOMEONE and SOMEONE near ground level center.
Leaning close, she reaches toward the map.
She turns, in a corner SOMEONE sits with concertina.
SOMEONE returns her gaze to the map.
SOMEONE drums the flat ends of his concertina.
He sips a drink.
She pauses as he gets to his feet.
SOMEONE  blinks at him and cocks her head.
SOMEONE lifts his brow persistently.
SOMEONE looks away then faces him with a coy smirk.
As she marches out, SOMEONE gazes after here.
As the storm rages outside, SOMEONE's helmet view shows fluid streaming from the urns.
They wander the chamber.
SOMEONE exhales smoke in his helmet.
SOMEONE sucks through a plastic hose, then blows a puff of smoke.
SOMEONE flips the British bird.
Using a space blanket, SOMEONE flips it back.
Black fluid streams along the ground.
A snake-like creature rises from the muck.
The cockpit stands empty.
As he edges closer, it rears up.
SOMEONE falls back on his rear end.
He reaches a hand out. The creature's head fans out, takes the shape of a porpoise tail.
Grinning, SOMEONE lingers close.
He reaches out again.
The creature's hood wraps around his hand and holds on tight.
It's serpentine body lashes around his arm.
It snaps his arm like a twig.
Using a knife, SOMEONE decapitates it. It sprays green blood, which burns through his helmet acidly.
The creature's head regenerates and it burrows up SOMEONE's sleeve.
It reaches his helmet.
SOMEONE falls face first into the black fluid. As he straightens, his melting helmet collapses on his face.
The serpentine creature plunges into SOMEONE's mouth and forces its way down his throat.
Now, from the dome's crust, we view a golden sun peeking over the horizon.
Silhouetted against the windows of SOMEONE's quarters, Holloway hunches over and rubs his face.
As his partner slumbers peacefully, he shuffles to a mirror. A light switches on above him.
Facing his reflection, he blinks his bleary eyes. He takes a few deep breaths, then removes a gold ring and sets it on the sink.
Bending over, he splashes water over his face and close cropped hair.
Facing the mirror again, he peers at his beady bloodshot eyes.
Broken blood vessels redden the rims of his irises.
Holloway knits his brow and leans closer to the mirror.
He lifts a hand hesitantly, then tugs down on the skin beneath his eye.
Clear fluid streams from his iris.
She touches an intercom.
Now an away team leaves the airlock.
All but SOMEONE board a transport.
Holloway regards him suspiciously.
As the transport pulls out, SOMEONE rides beside it on an ATV.
A lone crew member sees them off, then twirls his finger in the air.
Later, the vehicles approach the structures gateway.
Riding behind the transport, SOMEONE halts and gazes after it as it passes through.
Later in the structure.
the team progresses downhill to a large open doorway shaped like an egg.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE rides the ATV through the structure's tunnels.
Sipping from a porcelain cup,
SOMEONE monitors him by way of a private station.
She keeps her back to us. Her straight blond hair flowing smoothly past her shoulders.
SOMEONE halts the ATV with a frown.
SOMEONE removes his helmet.
His suit's camera shares his view as he proceeds down a corridor marked with urn-shaped etchings.
He pauses, frowning gravely.
Several yards ahead in a rounded turn, a red probe light pulsates.
With an intense stare, he proceeds toward it.
In her lifeboat, SOMEONE watches the feed projected across her windows.
As SOMEONE progresses, we find the probe hovering before a heart shaped door of multiple oblong panels.
SOMEONE eyes the probe quizzically, then turns.
As SOMEONE looks on, he enters a code into a panel beside the door.
It rises and the probe soars through.
As SOMEONE ventures forward, the doorway shows thousands of urns stacked in giant hourglass-shaped units.
The probe casts its flickering light at the far end of the chamber as the android goes in.
He observes three hourglass formations before him.
Even more urns rest in rows several feet high in recesses cut into the surrounding walls.
SOMEONE's screen shows the countless supply.
Looking on, SOMEONE narrows her blue eyes.
Crossing the mist enshrouded floor, SOMEONE arrives at another code panel.
He operates it successfully and a door rises before him.
The probes dart past two humanoid figures standing on either side in suits and masks.
SOMEONE shines his light on the apparent corpses.
Turning ahead, he slows, his lips parting.
The probe darts out past him as he enters the chamber.
Sarcophagus-like pods lie before him.
As SOMEONE watches from her lifeboat, SOMEONE cuts off the video feed.
Within the chamber, we drift up to find two more giant pods resting opposite their counterparts atop a hundred foot disc marked with a spiderweb-like pattern.
Massive pillars stripe the surrounding concave walls.
SOMEONE ventures in, dwarfed by the massive disk.
The rest of the away team arrives at the chamber with the bust.
SOMEONE eyes the humanoid corpse.
Behind SOMEONE, Holloway stumbles.
They enter the fatal chamber.
SOMEONE leans over an urn, peering closely with his flashlight.
The team moves through the dark, treacherous space.
As SOMEONE stares, SOMEONE finds a body lying face down in his suit.
He sits on the ground.
His skin bears no color. The others find SOMEONE's face green and distorted.
The serpentine creature leaps out at them.
It slithers away.
Leading the team out, SOMEONE supports Holloway.
Ducking out, Holloway collapses.
SOMEONE passes Ravel.
As she goes, Ravel watches the monitors.
At the edge of the giant disk, SOMEONE circles around a curved, throne-like chair to a control panel with rows of buttons the size and shape of eggs.
As he presses a sequence of them
they squish beneath his touch like soft hollow rubber.
An untouched button on the end pulsates with light from within.
SOMEONE presses it.
The throne-like chair rotates in his direction.
His flashlight sweeps over a treelike design on the backrest with twin egg-like patterns at the top.
SOMEONE climbs on the seat and leans back into it.
A holographic recording plays back.
Showing a helmetless engineer stepping up on the disk.
SOMEONE grins giddily.
SOMEONE shines his flashlight at the first, who bends over at one of the sarcophagus-like pods.
He gestures to a few others, who walk in and circle the disc.
One continues toward SOMEONE.
The Android springs from the chair as the engineer takes a seat in it.
SOMEONE cocks his head.
Curiously looking on as the alien rotates the chair to face the controls.
He picks up a reed-like flute and plays.
A blue and green holographic sphere rises before the pilot.
Connected to the horse shoe shaped panel by streams of green energy.
As the pilot works the controls, more emerald hued fields of energy appear above them.
SOMEONE lowers a gloved hand,
and the energy rises up to connect with it.
The android climbs up on the disc and crouches, studying the control panel.
In the recording, the leader walks over to the pilot and crouches to face him.
SOMEONE listens to their exchange.
A tremendous, three-dimensional holographic orb appears over the center of the disc. Cerulean points of light webbed together within swirl about in steady patterns.
A star system appears in its midst, complete with a ringed planet.
Staring, SOMEONE approaches the intergalactic map.
Higher up, smaller spheres with concentric orbital rings revolve around the disk.
SOMEONE steps into the mains sphere and orbital rings appear around it.
Spreading his arms wide, the pilot leans back as if playing an organ.
The main sphere diminishes and darts aside. One of the smaller orbs takes its place and grows. Smiling wondrously in its midst,
SOMEONE looks up and finds a glowing sphere hovering directly above him.
He spreads his arms wide and turns on the spot.
The pilot presses more buttons and another orb drifts downward in a net of green energy beams.
Reaching up, SOMEONE catches it lightly in his gloved hand.
As he peers curiously at the softly glowing orb, we recognize the continent of Africa.
He releases the model of earth, letting it float back up again and gazes after it ardently.
His arms spread, SOMEONE sways on the spot.
The recording abruptly cuts out.
As SOMEONE steadies himself his bewildered gaze lands on the holographic model of earth.
Rotating inches above a translucent cone-shaped face the image fades.
SOMEONE turns.
A  soft golden glow flickering on his face.
From within one of the pods an amber light fades.
Aiming his flashlight, the android approaches it wearily.
Its ornate translucent lid ends at the head with an egg-shaped hatch equipped with a handle.
SOMEONE flashlight beam shines through the barrier, revealing an engineer lying inside.
He rests motionlessly with his eyes closed and a breathing mask covering his nose and mouth.
SOMEONE plants a gloved hand and the lid and crouches close to the pod.
Turning his head  he leans an ear close to it.
SOMEONE's lips curl into a happy smile.
Meanwhile the rest of the team boards the transport.
SOMEONE cradles Holloway as he arrives.
Discolored bumps on his skin spread and darken.
The transport doors open.
The crew climbs out.
SOMEONE strides through the hanger and grabs a flamethrower.
As the door lowers, SOMEONE stops halfway down, wielding the menacing weapon.
Holloway collapses.
As SOMEONE goes to help, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE.
Holloway steps toward SOMEONE, his arms outstretched. SOMEONE holds SOMEONE back. SOMEONE ignites the flamethrower, setting Holloway on fire.
His body completely engulfed Holloway drops to his knees. SOMEONE sobs on the ground.
As Holloway's fiery body falls face first and lies still,
SOMEONE watches with a horrified expression.
SOMEONE opens her mouth wide in a grief stricken wail.
Later, wearing a white tunic,
she sleeps on a wide lit exam table.
A pair of hands reach for her cross,
and she instinctively grabs at them.
SOMEONE nods gently, and she allows him to remove her necklace.
As he steps away, SOMEONE lets her arms relax at her sides.
He puts the cross in a jar.
He runs a scan of her abdomen.
SOMEONE sits up, her jaw slack.
She stares wide-eyed and her lips stammer.
She scoots off the table.
She taps buttons on the exam table's panel.
She grips his shoulders.
Her mouth opens wide and she doubles over.
SOMEONE injects her in the back of the shoulder.
He lifts her limp body back on to the table.
As SOMEONE shifts to lie on her back, SOMEONE gazes down at her.
A tear falls from SOMEONE's eye and she shakes her head in confusion.
SOMEONE's lips tremble.
SOMEONE snatches the jar with her necklace and strides out.
SOMEONE, lying nearly motionless, stares up at the ceiling.
Taking a few deep breaths she drifts off to sleep.
She lies asleep on her side.
A hand in an oversized yellow glove gives her cheek a few brisk taps. SOMEONE remains motionless.
As a crewman in a containment suit approaches, SOMEONE whacks him with a metal object, then heads forward.
As the crewman forces her down, SOMEONE presses up on the plastic covering his face. She kicks him off of her.
As she gets down from the table, she falls briefly, clutching her abdomen.
SOMEONE races from the room but almost immediately collapses against the wall in pain.
Gritting her teeth she hurries on.
SOMEONE arrives in the room housing Vickers' med pod. She uses its touchscreen panel.
She selects manual procedure.
As the med pod rotates and tilts into an upright position,
the clear domed lid opens in three sections.
SOMEONE quickly removes her white hospital gown, revealing her bandage-like underwear, and grabs two auto-injectors.
She holds one in her mouth as she stabs her thigh with the other.
She limps over to the med pod and positions herself on the upright table under a curved scanner.
As the two bottom sections of the lid come together like a set of doors,
the upper section lowers down over the patient.
SOMEONE's taut belly bulges.
As the med pod lowers back down, SOMEONE scoots herself into position. She makes a few selections from a touch screen, projected over her head.
The scanner glides over her body.
A band of green light scans her abdomen.
As her stomach bulges up normally an image of the alien fetus appears on the screen before her.
A robotic arm equipped for surgical tools sprays anesthetics across her stomach below her belly button.
Three more arms position themselves.
One of the arms performs a precision cut with a laser.
SOMEONE arches her head way back.
The muscles in her neck tense as she grits her teeth.
As the robotic arms on either side of her pry back her skin,
SOMEONE's mouth opens wide in a pained SOMEONE. A large pair of forceps rotates into position at the top of the arched scanner.
As they lower toward her, SOMEONE gives herself another injection.
Her head relaxes back, then tenses again as the forceps dip into her open abdomen.
The forceps slowly pull the creature out. A thick tentacle wiggles inside an egg-shaped sac the size of SOMEONE's head.
Relaxing a bit SOMEONE lifts her head of the table and stares slack-jawed.
The sac brakes open splattering her with bloody fluid and revealing the squid-like alien.
She quickly grabs the umbilical cord and yanks it out. As she makes a selection on the overhead screen, the alien's four tentacles spread open and it moves its head.
Gritting her teeth, SOMEONE watches the robotic arm staple her stomach shut.
Above her the alien baby wriggles more vigorously.
Flailing its tentacles it tries to free itself from the forceps' grip.
The med pot starts to tilt upright and SOMEONE slams a button beside her.
The lid slowly opens. SOMEONE scoots down, flattening her head to one side it passes under the flailing alien.
Reaching the end of the table she quickly rushes around to the outer control panel.
The doors close back up, trapping the baby alien inside, and a white mist fills the chamber.
SOMEONE sinks to her knees and catches her breath.
She grabs some more auto-injectors from a cart,
then watches the baby alien grow still.
She quickly opens the room's door and hurries out of Vickers' life boat.
Inside the med pod blood drips from the alien's long egg-shaped head as it hangs motionless.
Now, on the bridge.
A crewman stops halfway down the lowering ramp in a space suit and helmet.
He cocks his head, then moves closer to SOMEONE who sits crouched on the ground with his legs bent forward over his shoulders.
On the bridge, SOMEONE's eyes shift nervously.
The crewman kicks SOMEONE's foot,
then backs away a few steps. He turns to a crewmate.
SOMEONE stands upright.
His smashed open helmet reveals his grotesquely deformed features.
The mutant backhands him, breaking open his helmet.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE hurriedly limps down a corridor. In the hanger, the mutant SOMEONE flings Wallace to the ground.
The mutant leaps on Wallace's stomach and the crewman spews blood. The mutant smashes both fists through his helmet, pummeling his face.
A crewman fires at the mutant, who turns his head angrily. Meanwhile SOMEONE turns briefly as she makes her way past a hanging space suit. A door to another corridor opens for her.
Meanwhile,  crewmen fire flamethrowers and guns at the mutant.
On fire, the mutant speedily scales a smooth wall, then leaps down, tackling a crewman. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand at the air-locked door.
Two guys fire on the mutant as he flings a third against a transport's window. As the men escape into a transport, the mutant lodges a metal tool into ones back and pulls him out.
The mutant falls back and the guys run over him with the transport.
As the vehicle takes off, SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive, dousing the mutant with fire and bullets.
SOMEONE lowers the flamethrower and watches the body burn.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE gives herself another shot, then drops the auto-injector.
Our view rises from her thigh up her blood-spattered body to her drawn face.
She peers down a corridor, then lowers her hand from a concave wall, and shuffles toward a set of rounded doors.
She presses a button and the doors part.
She staggers into a room and collapses to her knees.
A man dressed in white notices her,
then helps her to her feet along with a guard.
SOMEONE notices her as well.
He quickly takes off his white coat and wraps it around the half-naked woman.
SOMEONE stares at her, sitting in a wheelchair.
He watches as the guard helps her take a seat.
Shivering, SOMEONE notices the old man.
SOMEONE returns to SOMEONE and kneels on the floor.
He washes the old man's feet.
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a cane.
then helps him put on his slippers.
SOMEONE and the aid help the decrepit old man to his feet.
SOMEONE turns away from SOMEONE and his aide readies his wheelchair.
SOMEONE lowers her distraught gaze.
Now in her cabin, she leans over her sink.
She splashes water on her face, then looks over the counter.
She picks up Holloway's ring, studies it, then slides it the ring finger of her left hand.
Gazing thoughtfully, she covers her mouth.
As she sets her hands on the counter, we glimpse the line of staples two inches under her navel.
Nodding, she glances around, then looks over the counter.
She pops a pill in her mouth, then drinks from a glass of water.
Later, she puts on her spacesuit and zips it up.
SOMEONE enters the cabin and notices his colleague in her formfitting suit.
SOMEONE returns to the sink and pops another pill.
SOMEONE heads out.
He stops at the door, then returns to SOMEONE.
Holding her gaze SOMEONE steps back and leans against the wall.
Now in SOMEONE's bedchamber, SOMEONE stands by as SOMEONE works on the back of the old man's space suit.
Doors part for SOMEONE and she steps into the room.
Two guards stand outside.
SOMEONE and the others step out, then the door slides shut, leaving SOMEONE alone with the old man.
SOMEONE peers at her.
He sits on his bed.
She approaches him and he averts his gaze.
Kneeling, she caresses his hand.
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE bows her head.
She rubs her nose over his knuckles and he makes a fist.
She looks up at him.
He meets her piercing gaze.
She rises to her feet, Now, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE sitting in the corner of an equipment room.
He picks up a helmet.
Meanwhile SOMEONE walks down a corridor with SOMEONE and his aide close behind.
SOMEONE stands.
She doubles over in pain.
SOMEONE crosses the room.
Now a transport vehicle sets out from the ship leaving a trail of dust in its wake.
Later, in the network of tunnels, a flashlight shines through the darkness, leading the team.
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE slack-jawed.
A door rises and SOMEONE leads the group onward.
SOMEONE lags behind. The only one still wearing her helmet. As she shines her flashlight over the urns, SOMEONE watches a video feed from the bridge.
SOMEONE looks over the urns. The captain leaves his chair.
SOMEONE sits at a work station.
SOMEONE stands at the layout table.
A hologram shows the tunnel system without the surrounding terrain.
An alarmed SOMEONE stands upright.
The hologram represents an elaborate crescent shaped vessel with blunted ends.
Now SOMEONE leads the group into the chamber housing the giant disc.
He hops down from the platform, then sits in the chair and blows into the flute, calling up a holographic orb.
crosses the disc.
He leads them to the working pod.
SOMEONE collapses to her knees in pain.
SOMEONE takes off her helmet.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from the bridge.
SOMEONE touches amber lit symbols on the pod.
It opens.
SOMEONE steps past his aide who lowers a gun.
As the engineer sits up, several tubes detach from his oxygen mask.
He takes off his headgear and hunches over.
As he rises to his feet more tubing detaches. Standing upright, the pale bald titan looks over his mesmerized visitors.
As the engineer crouches, SOMEONE stumbles but SOMEONE and his aide catch him.
The engineer looks at SOMEONE.
The aide strikes SOMEONE in the gut with his gun.
The engineer looks at SOMEONE who eagerly waits for a reply.
He gently lays his hand on the top of SOMEONE's head.
With both hands, he grabs SOMEONE by the throat, then lifts him off his feet and breaks his neck.
He rips SOMEONE's head off and strikes SOMEONE with it. The aide shoots the engineer, and he drops the head.
The engineer turns SOMEONE around and palms her chest, knocking her off the platform.
He strikes the aide, flings him into a wall across the chamber, then spots SOMEONE running away, but lets her go.
SOMEONE slows to a stop and braces herself on a wall.
Now SOMEONE lies wounded on the floor.
SOMEONE's head lies about a foot away.
Eyes open, the android twitches.
On the bridge SOMEONE watches a video feed showing her father's heart rate.
She leaves the monitor.
Ravel watches the feed.
SOMEONE looks at his rattled shipmate, then lowers his gaze. He licks his lips, then shifts in his seat.
SOMEONE rubs his mouth.
Now the engineer crouches over the holographic orb.
The center of the disc drops, then rotates counter clockwise and opens for a head and pillar to emerge.
SOMEONE tries to look in its direction.
The engineer stands upright.
The rising pillar tilts, attached to a base with a seat,
like a cannon attached to a gunner chair.
The engineer faces the imposing device. SOMEONE watches him.
The gunner chair rotates.
Running through a tunnel, SOMEONE glances back.
As the engineer climbs onto the gunner chair, we glimpse SOMEONE's motionless face in profile.
The engineer takes a seat, then activates the star map.
A holographic sphere emerges around him, and widening outer rings flip into place.
SOMEONE stops to catch her breath.
As the engineer works the controls, a brief flash illuminates his crescent shaped ship. A helmet closes over him.
The helmet shields his face, then more armor shields his body. Smoke blasts from a circle of ports, blotting out our view of the ship's underbelly.
A torrent of smoke shoots through the tunnel, knocking SOMEONE off her feet.
The exhaust hurls her through  passage leading outside.
Through a window, the crew watches thin plumes of smoke rise from the ground.
As our view retracts through the star map a holographic line sets out from the gunner chair and targets hologram of the planet earth.
Amid the flow of exhaust, SOMEONE grabs hold of a ledge, and pulls herself out of a hole in the ground.
She rises to her feet, standing beside one of the erupting plumes. She runs for SOMEONE, but the ground fissures, threatening to cut her off from the ship.
As the gap widens she jumps the fissure and runs on.
We glimpse the ceiling opening up over the crescent shaped ship.
Running for SOMEONE, SOMEONE jumps another gap, but falls short and grabs hold of the opposite ledge.
She pulls herself up, then finds her path blocked for certain.
SOMEONE glimpses the rising ship, then flees the shifting ground.
As she dashes across the rocky terrain, the massive ship ascends in the background.
SOMEONE stumbles but gets up and takes cover behind a rocky pillar.
SOMEONE gives his captain an affirming glance.
Now SOMEONE runs through a corridor, unzipping her clothes. Reaching the escape pods she opens a pod door and grabs a space suit.
Blue flames ignite from the engines. SOMEONE puts on his baseball cap as he takes the helm.
The four firing engines lift the SOMEONE off the ground.
The crescent shaped ship rotates, its blunted ends turning toward the human's vessel as it rises into the sky.
The lifeboat section ejects from the ship. SOMEONE readies her space suit.
The lifeboat lands on the barren terrains, smashing a rocky pillar before it slides to a stop.
On the bridge.
SOMEONE gets in the escape pod
The pod ejects from the ship
SOMEONE watches as it loops around and swoops past her.
Touching ground, it slides to a stop.
In the cockpit, SOMEONE stands at the helm, his shipmate seated behind him.
SOMEONE rockets towards its target.
The three shipmates raise their arms overhead.
SOMEONE's nose pierces the outer wall of the larger ship, creating a fiery explosion.
As the engineer's ship careens a brilliant burst flashes,
Followed by an outpouring of smoke and SOMEONE.
SOMEONE watches from the ground as does SOMEONE.
the crescent shaped ship turns sideways and descends to the ground.
One of its blunted ends crash lands before the two survivors.
Huge plumes of smoke and SOMEONE billow from the point of impact. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare at the towering vessel, their jaws hanging slack.
The crescent shaped ship rolls their way, tipping on to the second of its blunted ends. SOMEONE and SOMEONE break into a run.
The second massive stub crashes into the ground behind them, and the ship keeps rolling.
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE desperately try to outrun the trundling vessel, fiery chunks of SOMEONE strike the ground all around them.
The rolling ship chases them past a number of rocky pillars, dotting the harsh terrain, its shadow at their heels.
SOMEONE trips and falls face down.
As SOMEONE keeps running, SOMEONE looks up at the looming mass, then rolls out of its way.
She rises to her knees and watches SOMEONE fall to the ground up ahead.
Flailing on her back, SOMEONE watches the ship's outer wall close in.
The ship' slows to a stop.
Now on its back, its blunted ends aloft.
Gawking at the towering vessel, SOMEONE rises to her feet.
The upright ship begins to tip her way.
She falls on her rear, scurries back toward some jagged rocks, then watches one end of the ship come down with no chance of escape.
As the impact plots out our view, we glimpse a burst of sparks.
SOMEONE lies in a pocket left underneath the ship, saved by the formation of jagged rocks behind her.
She looks at her wrist then turns on her side and glances around.
She crawls out from under the ship.
She rises to her feet, staggers a few steps, then glimpses an expanse of the vessel's outer wall.
The engineer's ship forms a semi-circle around her.
Turning, SOMEONE sees the lifeboat and staggers over the SOMEONE littered ground.
Small fires dot the field.
Nearing the craft, SOMEONE pauses and doubles over.
Straightening she sways on her feet, then perseveres  to the compartment's open entryway and climbs up.
She swings her legs over, pushes herself up on all fours and gets to her feet.
SOMEONE stumbles to a touchscreen control panel and works it with shaking hands.
A pair of doors slides shut behind her, sealing her inside.
She packs supplies from nearby shelves.
SOMEONE halts and turns.
Her eyes wide, she looks over her shoulder at the doors.
Facing forward, she reaches into low tool compartment and takes out a fire ax with a curved handle.
Doors ahead open, revealing the devastated remains of SOMEONE quarters.
On the far end, the false windows show the video of the little girl playing the violin.
Broken hoses, tubes and wires dangle from the ceiling panel surrounding the chandelier.
SOMEONE shovels in, removes her helmet and sets it aside.
Sparks rain down erratically from the ceiling as she ventures past the bar, her axe ready, and approaches a doorway.
Pausing at its threshold, she raises the axe and gazes down a brief passageway ending in a sealed door with two small windows.
She precedes hesitantly.
Breathing through flared nostrils.
Wet with condensation, the doors windows show the med pod moving on its own in the flickering light.
SOMEONE leans her face close to the glass peering through.
As we watch her from the other side we find blood smearing the door.
A giant tentacle slaps against the glass. SOMEONE backs away, her mouth hanging open in a terrified stare.
The tentacle rubs persistently against the window then slides down the glass.
As SOMEONE turns, the remaining engineer forces a pair of side doors open and leans through.
Charging, he backs her against a wall.
She pounds a touchscreen, a tentacle shoots out through the med pod station doors lashes around the engineer's throat and tackles him, taking SOMEONE down with them.
As the creature wraps its tentacles around the engineer, she wriggles out from beneath them both.
A spare tentacle wraps around her ankle, but she kicks it lose and scrambles away.
The creature lifts the engineer off the floor.
Grabbing her helmet, SOMEONE rushes back to the airlock compartment.
In the lifeboat, the engineer struggles pitily against the grasp of the giant squid-like creature
Flaps on its underside blossom outward like petals, revealing egg-shaped buds surrounding a vertical mouth lined with dagger-like teeth.
The engineer braces his legs against the door frame.
SOMEONE opens the air locked doors with her back and hand, then jumps out and lands in a hard roll.
In the lifeboat, the engineer snarls at the creature pulling him ever closer.
Yet another tentacle reaches out and wraps around his head.
The buds shoot out tendrils that lash around his skull and hold him still.
The mouth launches a serpentine appendage down the engineer's throat.
It pulls him close, then lowers itself on top of him.
The giant squid-like creature wriggles around completely covering its prey.
It eventually relaxes and grows still.
Outside the sun peeks through thick rolling clouds. SOMEONE weeps on her back.
On the disc, SOMEONE's head sweats.
Outside SOMEONE lifts her head.
Grimacing painfully, SOMEONE sits up.
Her gaze darts to a wrecked ATV half-buried in a mound of dirt.
In the ship, light wavers on SOMEONE's glistening face.
He listens uncertainly.
the ATV kicks up dust as SOMEONE drives it over the uneven terrain toward the engineer's crashed ship.
she steps into its dim cockpit.
Light flashes erratically.
A few feet from his head, SOMEONE's body twitches. SOMEONE steps closer and looms over them coldly.
SOMEONE puts down her bag and removes her protective space helmet.
Crouching at the android's body she rummages around and finds her cross.
Gazing tenderly at it, SOMEONE gently straightens the chain.
She solemnly puts it on over her head
and gives a relieved sigh.
Looking on, SOMEONE smiles admiringly.
SOMEONE crouches over his head.
The android stares at her with parted lips. He clamps his mouth shut.
Now, SOMEONE uses a line and pulley to lower SOMEONE's body out of an opening in the ship's hull.
His head lies on the floor by her feet, gazing up at her placidly.
The body touches down gently.
SOMEONE picks up his head in both hands. SOMEONE gives her a childlike appreciative smile as she lowers him into her bag.
The wind musses his hairline.
SOMEONE zips the bag closed over his earnest gaze.
Wincing painfully she gets to her feet and hauls the bag up.
From the edge of the hull, she repels 20 feet to the ground.
the ATV travels away from the structure along the desert valley.
It approaches the next structure.
Now we ascend through clouds.
An engineer ship rises into view.
Flaring brilliantly it darts away.
Beyond the clouds, the ringed planet glows. Fade to black.
In the abandoned lifeboat the last engineer's body convulses on the floor, surrounded by the creature's motionless tentacles.
In the flickering pulsating light his chest bulges.
An exoskeletal point resembling a giant
claw bursts out and slices through his sternum.
A skinny body with long limbs in a gleaming dark gray exoskeleton wriggles out of the hole and onto the floor.
A yellow amniotic sac pulsates beside it,
connecting the newborn to the engineer's carcass.
The new alien specimen pushes itself up on all fours. It lifts its head which bears the oversized claw like growth as a sickle shaped head crest.
The alien straightens, sitting up on its heels and looks around.
It works its slavering jaws.
A set of inner jaws pops out from its mouth.Its pink gums dripping slime.
The thieves hustle out.

Later, in a bath chamber, steam rises from a large vat. Two maids bustle out leaving SOMEONE and SOMEONE alone.
She halts in the doorway.
She turns back to SOMEONE at the door.
Her gaze darts as she arches her brow, affecting an air of indifference.
The archer stands stiff as she unbuttons a clasp at this throat. She lays the ends of the chain mail hood on his shoulders.
She obediently removes the cape like garment and sets it down, then yanks out the lacings of his tunic setting it aside as well. She works on his chain mail sleeve. SOMEONE watches tenderly.

Warm light flickers on a hefty four poster bed. Curtains separate it from a sitting area in front of a fireplace where SOMEONE tosses bedding to the floor and eyes the archer haughtily.
She gestures at the bedding, then strides to the curtains toward her bed.
She whips the curtains shut and SOMEONE plods over to the bedding with the dogs.
SOMEONE lights a candle.
SOMEONE glances at the curtains. Back lit by the candle, the sheer fabric offers a thinly veiled view of SOMEONE stepping out of her dress. SOMEONE lies down in front of the fire and pets a wolf hound lying next to him. Resting his head on his hand, he looks to the curtain. SOMEONE's silhouette pulls another layer off over her head, leaving her clad only in her chamois. SOMEONE politely rolls onto his back and looks away. Now, the bare branches of towering trees sway against the sky. SOMEONE leaves a camp and prowls into the misty woods.
A figure rises from the darkness. Moonlight gleaming on his conical helm. He and SOMEONE hike the short distance toward each other.
The Frenchman smirks and steps to SOMEONE's side and gestures toward the forest. 
Dozens of armed French soldiers appear in the mist and head toward them. Daytime. In a dove cote, a shaggy bird keeper, as they flutter away, he seizes one.

As they pass the South Korean soldiers at the raised barricade, she blinks tearfully. The unshaven man takes a step forward his expression inscrutable.
She strides toward the civilian who stares anxiously at her injured face. Jagged geometric pieces of the image separate from each other like shards of glass. The central pieces slide together and form a title as the picture around them fades to black. Salt. Now pedestrians pass a high-rise apartment building. Words appear, Washington D.C. present day. In an apartment, the civilian works at a kitchen table, his cheeks now smoothly shaven. A scruffy dog yawns in a dog bed behind him. The blonde peeks at the man from around the doorway.

Enter it and the doors close.
And brutally with the blade. Meanwhile.
SOMEONE paces in the interrogation room.
In the hallway.

With her as she anxiously taps her phone against her hand.
With her back to the door, she sits on the edge of the table. A flashing red light pulses through the window from the hallway.
She looks up at a security camera in the corner and snaps her fingers.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter a security hub where a monitor shows SOMEONE in the elevator shooting his victims in the head.
She shows a photo.
A monitor shows SOMEONE in the hallway.

SOMEONE heads into a room with the fire extinguisher and some bottles of cleaning solutions.
SOMEONE opens a janitorial closet and removes a bottle from a cabinet. As the overhead lights flicker on, she glances up at a camera. She slides off her panties and uses them to cover its lens. Then tips over a table and unscrews one of its metal legs. Meanwhile, SOMEONE reads her file.

She tosses the SIM card on the floor. Shutting her eyes, she gently pounds the back of her head against the seat back then recalls SOMEONE showing her photographs of SOMEONE.
He hands her SOMEONE's book on Spiders.
To the high-rise.
Now inside the building, an elevator's door slide open and SOMEONE peeks into a hallway. She scurries to her apartment door where she slides a hidden key from the frame. As she enters the apartment, she grabs a tan overcoat from the hall and puts it on. Creeping to the living room, she pauses in a doorway to pick up a pair of boots. She carries them in her hands as she searches the apartment.
She passes a framed photo of the couple embracing.
Her gaze swivels from a hallway to the vacant living room.
SOMEONE runs over and she pats him.
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE scurries to an overturned chair. On a table beside it, she spots a half-eaten sandwich and an unfinished beer. SOMEONE wags his tail expectantly as SOMEONE hurries to an adjacent room.
Outside, agents flood out of vehicles and head toward the building.
Apartment, SOMEONE lowers a panel from the underside of a table, revealing a hidden gun. She grabs it.
her chest, finding a backpack, she slings it over her shoulder then jerks her gaze to the door.
SOMEONE scampers over.
He follows her down a hall and into a dark room. Meanwhile, the tactical team arrives on her floor with their guns drawn.
Using a bust statuette, he knocks away the remaining glass. On the wall just outside, SOMEONE climbs.
She grabs an air conditioning unit and crosses to its other side. As SOMEONE leans out the window.
Presses her back to the wall, hiding behind the air conditioner. He sweeps his gaze over the U-shaped courtyard then looks to the ground roughly ten stories below.
Stretches her leg across a cornered gap to another windowsill. Hugging the wall, she sidesteps to the next window. Her toes deftly feeling for its latch.
Now she reaches a window of a fire escape. Peeking inside, she sees a young girl in headphones doing homework at a table.
SOMEONE waves at her oblivious neighbor. As the young girl shifts her gaze, she notices the woman outside and returns the wave. SOMEONE beckons and the girl heads over.
She puts a pair of jeans on under her skirt.
Her friendly smile fades as SOMEONE catches her gaze. Staring at the dog, she remembers a butterfly soaring over SOMEONE's head in a pavilion filled with lush vegetation. He approaches a wandering SOMEONE.
He wears a mild boyish smile.
Later, he shows her a bulbous black spider resting in a glass-encased web.
Donning glasses, SOMEONE peers excitedly at the spider.
SOMEONE smiles, watching the spider pick its way up to a twig housing its web.
Back in the present, she walks down a sidewalk, a knit cap pulled over her hair. Leaving her building, SOMEONE spots her.
SOMEONE sprints away.
SOMEONE reaches a subway entrance and dashes down an escalator.
Then halts at the side of an SUV.
Now draws his gun and pursues SOMEONE on foot.
As another SUV arrives 
On a trailer of a passing semi with a hard bounce.
SOMEONE, as he fires again.
And two officers get out.
Pulls herself up to a stable position then crouches and gets her bearing.

In the SUV, SOMEONE takes a few steadying breaths.
SOMEONE gets a text.
Evelyn SOMEONE was injured during the Moscow car crash that killed her parents.
In the bathroom, SOMEONE kicks a feminine hygiene product dispenser off the wall. It opens as it lands and she takes a pad. Facing a mirror, she unwraps it. Then lifts her bloodstained shirt to reveal a gunshot wound at the top of her hip. She applies the pad to the injury then tucks it into her waistband. Shutting her eyes, she remembers lying on top of SOMEONE in bed. They kiss and wrestle playfully.
Inside, SOMEONE watches a newscast.
She remembers riding in the back of an SUV in Korea with SOMEONE's concerned gaze fixed on her.
She faces him, revealing her bruised swollen eye.
She cheerfully shuts her eyes and shakes her head.
She woefully meets his gaze.
SOMEONE gives a loving smile. Beaming tearfully, SOMEONE rests her head against her folded hands. SOMEONE holds her by the crook of her elbow. Taking his hand, she presses her lips to it. SOMEONE leans close and kisses the top of her blonde head. Back in the present, SOMEONE shifts her listless gaze. Now at a hotel's check-in desk.
On a hallway, the housekeeping woman removes garments from a rack of laundered clothes and takes them into a guest's room.
Passing the rack, SOMEONE snatches a garment in each hand without breaking her stride. Now she arrives at her deluxe room with the clothes draped over her arm.
Depositing her backpack on the bed, she moves through the space, examining it with a keen perceptive gaze. She peers into a bathroom then returns to the bedroom and removes her knit cap.
SOMEONE retrieves a jewelry box from a plastic bag containing cash and passports. She removes a set of false teeth from her mouth then takes out a pair of darkly tinted contact lenses from her pale blue eyes.
Now she lays out an assortment of handguns,
ammunition and hardware on the bed.
She presses a button on the square component and a red light illuminates.
Later SOMEONE uses a needle to draw clear venom from the spider. By her open laptop, a printer ejects a page headed, Subway System Access Tunnels. A blueprint reads Detail: St. SOMEONE Subdivision, and highlights a steam vent. Nearby, another print out bares the heading, Church Tunnels. SOMEONE crosses to a window, pulls the drapes aside a few inches and peers out. St. Bartholomew's Cathedral stands almost directly across the street, softly illuminated by outdoor flood lamps. Gazing wistfully at it, SOMEONE remembers swearing in as a CIA agent.
Back in the present, she dyes her hair dark. Daytime, rooftop secret service snipers monitor a funeral procession.
Across the street, a woman with dark brown hair looks on. As we revolve around her, we recognize SOMEONE's high cheekbones and bee-stung lips. At the cathedral entrance, SOMEONE stands between SOMEONE and a balding man. At the curb, a secret service agent opens a car door. Matveyev gets out and solemnly looks around. SOMEONE watches him proceed toward the entrance, flanked by a secret service detail.
She steps away. Matveyev pauses, casting about his weary gaze.
SOMEONE moves through the crowd, keeping an eye on him. From the church entrance, SOMEONE catches a glimpse of her. He narrows his eyes, trying to get a better look but she slips out of view.
The military dress uniforms carry a flag draped casket.
They bring the coffin to the church's entry way. Matveyev follows, flanked by his security.
And speeds through a subway tunnel. On board, a female police officer turns.
The fugitive pretends to read a folded newspaper.
SOMEONE drops the newspaper by the door and moves away as it smolders.
Now in the cathedral, a gray-haired man plays an organ. In front of him, dozens of men and women in the choir wear white robes and hold songbooks as they sing soberly.
In the congregation, Matveyev greets a middle-aged woman with auburn hair.
He approaches a lanky man in a row behind her.
The commander-in-chief moves aside, Matveyev sidles into his row and nods at the first lady.
He eases past her and stands at her side. At the front of the cathedral, the flag draped casket lies before the apse. In front of it, a soldier in dress uniform ends a salute and marches away.
The congregation and choir take their seats. The U.S. president kisses his wife then treads forward and tenderly lays his hand on the casket. On a mezzanine balcony, SOMEONE gazes down on the nave as the president moves toward a podium.
SOMEONE watches from a security hub in the sacristy.
He peers into the nave.
SOMEONE radios in.
SOMEONE jogs through an access tunnel with a low ceiling. In the cathedral.
As the steam fills a chamber beneath her, she reaches a door and peeks through its window into a hallway. Two security agents enter from another door.
He back down. His partner attacks once more but SOMEONE kicks him unconscious and runs off with his gun. Now Matveyev takes the podium. In a stairwell, SOMEONE dashes up several flights.
In the crypt, a door cracks open and SOMEONE peeks out. She aims a tiny mirror down the hallway and spots a security agent striding up. As the man reaches for his gun, the door swings open and SOMEONE leaps out. She boots him backward. Knees the weapon out of his hand.
Crouching, SOMEONE fires through the downed man, using him like a silencer.
Nails the approaching agent in his bulletproof vest.
Shoots another mechanism. In the cathedral, guests panic. Meanwhile, SOMEONE draws his gun. In the crypt chamber, SOMEONE attaches one of the detonator components to a brick of explosives. She tosses it upward and it magnetically adheres to a chandelier's base on the ceiling. In the mezzanine, SOMEONE radios in.
In the crypt, SOMEONE shines his flashlight at a dead guard. A cloud of dust fills the hallway ahead. Now in the smoke-filled organ chamber.
SOMEONE aims her gun through the cloud of dust and faintly glimpses Matveyev's form. She shoots him. In the hallway.
SOMEONE reacts to the sound and moves toward it. In the organ chamber, his flashlight glows through the dust. Its wavering beam glares brighter and
Her calm aim, hold steady.
She raises her hands, aiming the gun harmlessly at the ceiling then lets it drop.
Other agents enter.
A supervisor radios in.
Later outside.
He uses his cell.
The two men lock gazes. SOMEONE glances quizzically after SOMEONE and heaves a sigh. Now the three vehicle police convoy moves down a vacant city street. Later, it crosses the 59th Street Bridge. In the back seat, SOMEONE blinks.
Eyes. The lead cruiser veers to one side and passes a U-Haul truck.
SOMEONE tips her head back and studies the cruiser behind him in a rear view mirror.
In a flashback.
A girl enters a dormitory.
Bandages conceal her features.
She climbs into a bed next to SOMEONE's.
Moonlight glows on his scarred cheek.
One ramming his head into the window.
SOMEONE winces, bracing herself.
The SUV tips and smashes down onto all four wheels. Inside, SOMEONE steals a key ring from the driver's belt. Bystanders tread toward the passenger side of the SUV as SOMEONE slips out the driver's side. As two men rush to help the driver, she hides and unlocks the handcuffs. Later, she strides casually away with her hands in her pockets.
As the sleeper agent sunders pass the sidewalk vendor's hat rack, she steals an ushanka-style fur cap. Later, clouds fill the bright afternoon sky. Passengers sit calmly on a ferry.
And her shoulders wrapped in a knee length fur lined shawl. Sunlight flares on the misty air, starkly outlining her profile against the sea and the sky.
Bandages still cover much of her swollen face.
Young SOMEONE halts on his way out and she kisses his ring.
He hurries off down a long corridor. As the young girl stares longingly after him, a smooth featured man strides up.
Back in the present, SOMEONE stares off over the water. Later, the passengers file off the ferry, past a TV showing a newscast.
In a junkyard.
SOMEONE and others watch TV.
Give her a warm embrace. SOMEONE strokes SOMEONE's cheek.
She kisses his ring. Cradling his hand and both of hers, she takes a stroll with him across the salvage yard.
They hug again.
Is around a floating barrel and angles toward a boxy barge. A henchman wielding a rifle stands guard on its deck. SOMEONE studies him coolly.
SOMEONE beams. As SOMEONE leads her across a catwalk, her smile falters. She surveys some men working at a table beneath them.
He gestures her forward.
With a warm smile, SOMEONE proceeds down a set of stairs. Her Russian mentor follows close behind.
Reaching a dimly lit corridor, SOMEONE turns to find two thugs lifting a large circular hatch on the floor.
Her cool smile gone she ventures further in. SOMEONE trails his former protégée, observing her closely. The thugs step aside from the raised hatch. As SOMEONE peers down through the opening, a flashlight turns on to reveal SOMEONE bound with a chain.
A crimson rag gags his mouth. As SOMEONE stares at her husband, SOMEONE steps up beside her, scrutinizing her response. SOMEONE gazes up at her. His gray eyes wide. SOMEONE maintains her stony expression.
SOMEONE mashes his teeth around his gag as he stares pleadingly at his wife. She faces SOMEONE and her bee-stung lips curl into a cold smile.
A thug aims his rifle at her.
As SOMEONE turns away, her smile fades.
And then turns, a guard wrenches a valve.
Watching her husband's head thrash, SOMEONE struggles to fight back tears welling in her eyes.
She looks up at a guard in a suit, aiming a handgun at her. Blinking, she clears her eyes and faces SOMEONE without a hint of grief.
They drink their vodka.
To our family, sister. The man beside him nods to her.
In a flashback, SOMEONE glimpses young boys dressed in identical stripe shirts. Back in the present, SOMEONE escorts her into a radio room.
Some more vodka.
He marks a map.
Rams over and over. SOMEONE's head slips forward and the bloody bottle drops to the floor. SOMEONE's gaze darts.
She strides across the room and opens several cases of weapons. Then slaps a click into the butt of a handgun.
Falls dead beside his wounded comrade in a suit. As the terrified survivor struggles to crawl away, SOMEONE moves over him.
With gun, the man convulses then falls limp. SOMEONE turns away with a stony expression. Holding her gun at a ready, she steps to the edge of the stairwell. She checks a corridor for survivors then drops her gaze downstairs.
A dozen charred victims killed in the grenade blast lie in heaps around the open hatch.
SOMEONE's gaze softens. She stares at the dark shimmering water flooding the chamber below.
Her glistening eyes stare wistfully. In a flashback, SOMEONE wears a bridal veil. She giggles and buries her face against the shoulder of SOMEONE's neatly pressed suit.
Man in dress uniform steps up to SOMEONE.
She stares at him blankly.
She recalls the young boy with the scar on his cheek lying in the bed next to hers.
The man shows his scarred cheek.
In a seat facing her.
He hands her a badge.
He shows a blueprint.
SOMEONE holds her palms together as he cups her hands in his.
She locks eyes with him impassively. Nighttime. An aerial view shows the lights of Washington D.C. glowing around the dome of the capital building. Now SOMEONE drives an SUV up to a checkpoint, a guard hurries over.
One show SOMEONE with his alias, the other a young man named SOMEONE.
SOMEONE turns and lifts his arms.
The security agent runs a detection wand over him then lets him through.
SOMEONE watches her wave the wand over his colleague.
SOMEONE turns revealing his soft features and bee-stung lips. The impostor grabs her service cap and attaché case from a security conveyor belt then walks beside SOMEONE.
With the president.
The group boards an elevator. Back with the others.
As the adviser heads to the elevator, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE.
Later, SOMEONE throw SOMEONE to the floor.
The closing elevator doors, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE in her disguise. SOMEONE presses a remote then explodes.
In the hall. In the elevator.
In a smoke-filled hallway, SOMEONE rolls over and pushes herself onto her knees.
She grabs a set of keys and a gun off a fallen agent then hurries upstairs.
Adding herself in a room, she tears off her jacket.
SOMEONE shifts his eyes thoughtfully.
SOMEONE removes her false ears.
She rips it away from her nose and mouth. Back in the elevator.
The group hurries down a hall.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE sneaks downstairs.
The agent uses his radio.
Meanwhile hiding against the wall by the stairs, SOMEONE peers around the corner and sees a tactical team shuffling pass. Back with the president.
Agents hurry the president down a hall. SOMEONE sprints along at another.
Turning a corner, the president and his men approach an elevator.
They rush inside.
A guard station in the hall.
She pries the doors open and peers down into the shaft of the descending car. Her gaze sweeps to the metal framework along the walls and she leaps onto a crossbar.
Then jumps to a lower beam in the opposite corner. Continuing in this manner, she gradually descends floor by floor.
SOMEONE glances toward the ceiling.
An agent checks the entryway.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE tightrope-walks along the beam in the elevator shaft. At the bunker door.
In the shaft, SOMEONE sees two parallel rails running down a wall. Squeezing between them, she slides down like an elevator on its tracks. In the bunker corridor.
SOMEONE reaches the bottom of the shaft. Now the heavily reinforced bunker door swings open.
He addresses a bunker guard.
As the president and his entourage walk through the doorway, the guard enters a code on a keypad.
Using the stolen ID card, she unlocks the gate. Meanwhile.
The president and his men head to the emergency operation center. With them, a military aide carries a briefcase, its handle tethered to his wrist.
Satellite images appear.
The military aide sets his briefcase on the table.
And opens it and presses his thumb on a fingerprint scanner inside.
Back in the emergency operation center.
Secret service agent James joins a woman wearing a headset.
Enters a code on the control pad.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE hurries down a corridor. As two agents draw closer, she charges. She barrels one over then punches the other.
The first agent slams her. 
The first agent and he falls. As he reaches for his gun
He knocks down the other agent as well. In the operation center, the scanner verifies the President's palm print. The Secretary of Defense holds a phone receiver in each hand. At the Pentagon, military officials watch a news report.
A general picks up a red handled phone. Meanwhile, the Secretary
Of Defense hands one receiver to the president and the other to military aide.
He sits and types on his computer 
Code matches the general's.
The general hangs up. 
In the bunker with a two dead agents. Now Jenks turns to the lead bunker officer.
Through a doorway, they see Officer Dryers body fall to the ground.
SOMEONE steps away from it.
The President gapes. Outside the operation center, SOMEONE shifts her eyes. Back inside, SOMEONE aims his gun at the President.
He lowers himself into a chair. His eyes wide.
Over the table and SOMEONE shoots her. Meanwhile, SOMEONE approaches the room.
SOMEONE shoots him. Peering through a window, SOMEONE sees the commander-in-chief fall out of his chair. As SOMEONE removes his jacket, SOMEONE's gaze scans the room and takes in the dead body sprawled behind a control counter.
SOMEONE settles into a seat at the nuclear warfare computer.
SOMEONE presses a button on the wall intercom. Her eyes focused on her old colleague as he types.
He looks over.
SOMEONE smiles at him. He lifts his brow.
On the computer.
Who uses a blowtorch on the reinforced door. Now a status bar shows the authorization reaching 29%.
SOMEONE approaches the window separating him from SOMEONE.
SOMEONE stares into her pleading eyes. His jaws set tightly. Her breath fogs the glass.
A tiny smile touches SOMEONE's lips and he nods. As he turns from the window, he spots a news report on the monitor. A caption underneath footage of Matveyev reads, Russian President alive.
SOMEONE turns back to the window and steps closer. On the other side, SOMEONE stares unapologetically.
He leans his arms against the glass and looks into her eyes.
SOMEONE defiantly lifts her chin.
SOMEONE's lips spread into a smile.
SOMEONE fires a handgun at the bulletproof window.
Her bullets create a cluster of snowflake-like impressions in the glass. She drops her emptied handgun and raises an automatic rifle. As her shots fail to shutter the window, SOMEONE strolls back to the nuclear
Warfare computer.
And smashes the butt of her rifle.
In glass then notices a control pad by the door in the operation center.
She heads down a hall. SOMEONE glances
Into the biometric scanner.
His hand down on the scanning pad.
SOMEONE breaks part of the wall away to reveal an electronic device inside. She removes some wires from it. In the operation center, SOMEONE waits against the wall beside the door with his pistol in hand.
In the operation center.
She sinks to the floor.
SOMEONE marches to the controls. Scrambling to her feet.
A round kick, rushes to the launch controls and types.
Slams her down on the table.
SOMEONE lunges to the launch controls 
Tap a link cord. She get shot
SOMEONE lies face down watching tensely.
SOMEONE keeps his weary gaze fixed on SOMEONE. Taking her into custody, an officer yanks down her shirt and finds a bulletproof vest. Later, SOMEONE passes SOMEONE and his men in a corridor.
As SOMEONE gets led past, she jerks her chin up at SOMEONE.
He stares after her. Down the hall.
Now the agents escort SOMEONE of a curving flight of stairs to a landing, where SOMEONE lingers with the SOMEONE.
He slips a pair of scissors from the SOMEONE's bag then locks eyes with SOMEONE.
Secret service agents haul SOMEONE back up.
The agents back SOMEONE against the wall.
They shove her in and then one wraps a blanket around her shoulders.
She finds SOMEONE seated across from her.
Away from the rising helicopter, followed by another chopper
SOMEONE gazes listlessly out the window. Her nose, cheek, and mouth stained with dark blood clots. She sees the Washington Monument pass by. A red light blinking at its apex. SOMEONE studies her with a thoughtful gaze. The helicopters rise high above the city, silhouetted against a rose and indigo sky.
The agents look away uneasily.
The bald man avoids his hostile glare. SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE wearily. Her narrowed eyes glistening. He shifts angrily in his seat. SOMEONE coldly straightens and looks him in the eye.
His chest heaving, SOMEONE shifts his bewildered gaze then looks to SOMEONE again.
SOMEONE looks away. His lips tightly pursed.
He takes out his cell and eyes the display. It reads, Urgent message - fingerprints place SOMEONE on barge where SOMEONE was killed. SOMEONE looks up at the mysterious woman, who watches him with a steady earnest gaze. His brow creased. He puts the cellphone back in his pocket.
SOMEONE lowers his gaze to the handcuff around SOMEONE's wrist restraints. As he looks up at her blood stained face, her eyes glisten and she displays a big smile.
SOMEONE studies her resolute expression.
Craning his neck, he looks pass her to the FBI agents. He glances down again at SOMEONE's restraints then eyes the bald man. He talks on a headset. A window shows their approach over the Potomac River. SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a meaningful look which she registers coldly.
SOMEONE stares at him and he directs her gaze toward the window.
Seeing a river below, she discreetly unbuckles her seat belt. SOMEONE watches her gravely.
His lips screwed tightly. He glances out of the Potomac then directs her gaze to the door. It bears a semi-circular emergency release handle. Swallowing, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE's finger tap deliberately against his leg. She steals herself with a deep breath. As SOMEONE's hand closes into a fist, she lunges for the emergency release.
His brow furrowed. He stares into the water. It shows no sign of the mysterious woman.
Searching fruitlessly for SOMEONE, SOMEONE allows a smile and gives a satisfied nod.
They turn away from the Potomac's rocky bank.
The river's edge, hands caress at a snow blanket of rock as slim figure wades through the knee-deep water. SOMEONE rushes a shore and dashes through the woods, pumping her shackled arms. Leaning briefly against a tree trunk, she glances over her shoulder. She breathes hard through her parted lips. Her wet short hair clinging to her head. Her feet carry her over the forest snowy ground.
She watches SOMEONE's helicopter leaves the Potomac and its bordering wetlands. She ventures onward.
In the cockpit.
Covered valley.
Humongous hole in the Earth.
Inside the cave, a fair-haired man floats in shallow water.
Wearing only a wet suit, he goes through the motions of checking his equipment.
He shakes his head, then lifts it out of the water.
The fair-haired man gently swims across the rocky pool and climbs onto a ledge. A lanky man wearing a climber's helmet sits nearby. He gets up and moves a large backpack.
SOMEONE hands a camera to a goateed guy wearing a Ramones t-shirt.
The goateed guy leaves a canopy-covered station and steps past the two divers.
At the foot of another pool, he sets a shoebox-sized camera into the water.
He leaves the pool and sits behind a computer housed inside an orange plastic case.
Nearby, SOMEONE helps the female diver strap a rebreather to her back.
She gets a reading on a handheld device.
SOMEONE gets up from his station and faces her with his hands on his hips.

About halfway down, SOMEONE catches up with SOMEONE.
Surface, SOMEONE brings SOMEONE another cellphone.
He dives over the edge with open arms and falls into the dark abyss.
He lowers the phone.
It shines in through the distant aperture.
Returns to his work. SOMEONE and SOMEONE look on.
They each continue their descent. At forward base, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE releases Virgil into the pool and the robot sets off after the diver.
He watches them go underwater. 
a pale flashlight shines over the darkened rocks as a diver emerges from a narrow passage.
Flap of his swim fins propels the lead diver through the water. SOMEONE follow, shining her flashlight over the rock walls.
A single spotlight shines up from the floor as SOMEONE leads them through the darkened chamber.
At the other base camp, SOMEONE dunks a teabag into a mug.
Seated on a rock, he waits for SOMEONE and SOMEONE to reach the bottom.
Finger and he grins.
Water, SOMEONE detaches an air cylinder from the decompression chamber.
SOMEONE looks back at SOMEONE.
Mask. His shadow appears on the rock wall.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE and SOMEONE rappel down a craggy shaft.
Sitting back in her harness, her feet pressed against the rock wall.
SOMEONE descends another shaft. At forward base, SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a mug while SOMEONE
watches the divers on the monitor.
She eyes a tunnel blocked by a cluster of rocks. As SOMEONE clears the entrance, Virgil lines up behind them.
Last rock and gazes into a dark passageway.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch the monitor. Meanwhile, SOMEONE climbs out of shallow water onto a rock ledge where SOMEONE stands filming a cavern with a video camera.
She sits on the ledge above.
The tusk on a necklace.
SOMEONE unclips his extra oxygen tank and pushes it away.
He struggles through the narrow tunnel.
He follows close behind her, rebreather also removed from her back.
He works a joystick.
He flippers as she struggles forward.
As she pushes her rebreather, its pack snags on a rock.
SOMEONE continues on and SOMEONE follows.
Now in an area enveloped by darkness, a beam of light shines out, its radius growing larger as SOMEONE emerges from the tunnel into a cavern.
A wall below the tunnel. As SOMEONE emerges behind him, SOMEONE anchors a guide line to the cavern wall.
SOMEONE shines a flashlight.
Pointing his finger, he swirls it in a circle.
SOMEONE heads back to the tunnel.
As she sucks in a mouthful of water.
And then her body jerks.
Virgil glides over to SOMEONE who turns, peering out at SOMEONE from the monitor.
He squeezes his eyes shut. SOMEONE watches the monitor with a grave look and SOMEONE shifts his gaze away.
Now, SOMEONE' body floats against the decompression chamber outer wall.
His eyes fixed on his lifeless colleague.
Now at forward base, SOMEONE lugs a rebreather pack ashore as SOMEONE and SOMEONE come out of the water.
Sitting on the rock, the monitor replays SOMEONE's struggle with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE steps into view, his brow creased in anguish.
SOMEONE sees his father standing at the water's edge, his arms cradling SOMEONE limp body.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lifted on to the rocks.
Above ground, wind bellows through trees and lightning flashes.
Back at forward base, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE under the tent.
SOMEONE tries the radio.
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a sidelong glance, then sits beside SOMEONE who eats rice from a pot.
SOMEONE turns off the radio.
He sits heavily beside his son, pulls the cork from his tequila bottle, and takes a swig.

The young man swallows then lets out a deep breath.
SOMEONE lifts his head but avoids his son's gaze.
SOMEONE clenches his jaw and his nostrils flare. SOMEONE stands.
SOMEONE taps SOMEONE.
Tribal shaman elder lifts his face to the dark sky. Rain pours down on him.
The aerial shows the deluge plummeting into the cave's pitch black mouth.
His feet splashing in muddy water.
And SOMEONE eyes the boar tooth torch around his neck.
He tries to yank it off then glares at it.
As he tugs again.
He tilts his head alertly.
SOMEONE takes the lead.
At forward base, SOMEONE sits in front of the monitor swigging from his bottle. Sweeping his gaze around the cave, he wipes his mouth the back of his hand then picks up a flashlight. He glides his beam up a wall to a crevasse in the rock.
SOMEONE joins him. Sitting in front of the monitor, he eyes the onscreen footage of St. Jude's Cathedral where Virgil's light shines up a towering shaft toward the rippling surface of the air bell.
SOMEONE drinks from the tequila bottle.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE stops at a comm station.
Leaks through cracks, raining into the cave. SOMEONE gazes around.

SOMEONE packs.
SOMEONE rushes to a floating body bag and gently pulls it open to reveal SOMEONE' lifeless face.
SOMEONE watches, He remove the dead woman's wetsuit.
She folds her arms across her chest and stubbornly plants her feet.
SOMEONE gravely looks from her to SOMEONE.
Searching the area for supplies, SOMEONE heads around a large flowstone feature and halts. Two motionless legs float before him.
Pulling him into the light, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE's face pulverized beyond recognition.
The Eye opens.
SOMEONE hurries over.
He crouches by his gravely injured colleague.
SOMEONE queasily turns away.
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE away.
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE back.
The injured man wraps an arm around his friend's shoulder.
Then pushes against his throat. Maintaining his hold, the older man bites his lip.
SOMEONE's hand grabs his shoulder again, flexes weakly, and goes limp.
Now underwater, we peer up at four pairs of legs silhouetted against the light above the surface. There feet clad in flippers, they lazily tread water. Back at the large flowstone feature, SOMEONE crouches over his euthanized friend.
Now we float up toward the lazily kicking legs.
He lowers his goggles.
As their headlamps descend, the cave goes dark.
Now, SOMEONE leads the way through the narrow passage leading to the Devil's Restriction.
SOMEONE swims into view, pulling at the rocks beneath him. His father takes his hand, places it on the guide line, and gives the okay signal. SOMEONE returns the gesture. His father swims on, leading him through the winding passage.
SOMEONE passes the decompression chamber.
From a distance, we watch the team of divers recede into the murky depths.
A light on her rebreather pack glows green.
While SOMEONE soberly looks on. SOMEONE goes next, shoving his gear in before him.
The Restriction and swims in after it. Left alone, SOMEONE worriedly shakes her head and looks away.
SOMEONE's flippered feet paddle out of view.
Effort, she pushes her gear into the restriction.
Ahead, shimmering green light grows visible from around a bend.
Her eyes wide behind her goggles. Up ahead, SOMEONE pushes himself through the exit. His father hovers in St. Jude's Cathedral waiting for him.
Ahead, SOMEONE joins Franks, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE outside the tunnel exit.
With her fists. In the Cathedral, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE worriedly.
The others continue to wait in one line.
Grabs hold and jerks at it. Outside the tunnel, the exit shows no sign of her approach. SOMEONE taps his boss on the shoulder. As SOMEONE faces him, he points at his own eyes then at the restriction. SOMEONE shakes his head, wags a finger, then swims toward the tunnel himself.
A headlamp beam appears from the darkness.
SOMEONE turns to look as SOMEONE crawls into view.
He swims forward. SOMEONE rubs her arm.
Then jerks his thumb upward. Now, a beam of light shines toward the rippling surface of the air bell above.
SOMEONE removes his mouthpiece. 
On to the rocky bank, He pulls of an elastic band strapping a flashlight to his arm and turns on his helmet's secondary light.
Drips from his wetsuit as his lamp sweeps over the cavern. With an awestruck smile, he ventures forward.
The pool next and finds the financier wandering out of view.
The young man climbs up on an underwater ledge and raises his flippered feet.
Hiking over a ridge, SOMEONE finds a vast cavernous passageway ascending before him.
Dwarfed to a minuscule size by his surroundings.
And SOMEONE covers her with the metal tissue-thin space blanket.
He sits him down and hands him a rebreather. SOMEONE puts it to his mouth. Stepping away, SOMEONE reaches into his supply pack and pulls out a knife with a six inch blade.
SOMEONE grimly switches off his helmet lamp, so does SOMEONE.
Now, SOMEONE wakes up from a nap.
SOMEONE rubs SOMEONE's foot as she sits under the metallic blanket.
A veiny red discoloration on his left pack. As SOMEONE whispers to himself eyes closed, SOMEONE sits by him.
SOMEONE breaks off muttering and opens his eyes. SOMEONE shivers.
She flashes a meek smile. SOMEONE confers with SOMEONE.
The six inch knife in the ground is almost completely submerged.
Now, we drift over a rippling subterranean pond as the group crosses a cavern as big as a covered stadium.
SOMEONE steps out from behind a pitch black wall and shines his helmet light across a rocky passage. Water rains down lightly inside the sleek room-sized space.
SOMEONE climbs over a rock barrier carrying a yellow supply bag.
Just footsteps behind, SOMEONE follows.
SOMEONE comes next, then SOMEONE.
Bringing up the rear, SOMEONE stops and adjusts his helmet light. SOMEONE looks back at his hesitant friend who makes a fist and presses on.
Rocky partition and peers down a fairly spacious passageway, his helmet light striking the rain-like mist. He then sidles to his right and trains his light beam down a smaller tunnel.
SOMEONE marches on, saddled with gear. He stumbles.
SOMEONE continues up an incline.
They share a grin and SOMEONE leads them ahead.
SOMEONE's gaze grows mildly sullen and distant.
As SOMEONE eyes him squarely, SOMEONE deflects the order with a brotherly smirk.

SOMEONE continues on wearing a bulky white rebreather on her back.
On a ledge above them, SOMEONE hauls up his gear.
SOMEONE arrives.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE go looking for him.
SOMEONE leads the way into another rocky den.
A crude carving reads "George was here".
Blood trails from SOMEONE's mouth.
Light from his partner's helmet dwindles on the dying man.

Now, SOMEONE snaps photographs of the cave walls.
SOMEONE sits on a boulder nearby.
As SOMEONE returns with his camera, SOMEONE notices him.
SOMEONE hands supplies up to his father.
SOMEONE looks on uncertainly.
His father leaves SOMEONE who sits up, wincing.
A mildly defiant grin fades from SOMEONE's face. SOMEONE rubs his neck.
A slack-jawed SOMEONE drops his hand on his lap.
He looks at SOMEONE who sadly gazes at the floor. SOMEONE squeezes SOMEONE's shoulder then leaves his side.
SOMEONE fixes the collar of his vest and hangs his head.
Now, SOMEONE marches alone through another cavern, his helmet light shines over a winding path through the uneven rock floor. SOMEONE's light shines about 50 yards up ahead.
SOMEONE appears just inside it.
The veteran caver peers through the opening into another darkened chamber. He sets down his yellow supply bag.
Catch up and set down their own gear. As SOMEONE crawls through the opening, his helmet light dims out. He holds his hand before it to verify. SOMEONE and SOMEONE rest.
Walls bears some irregularities. SOMEONE spots a ledge and opening across the cauldron.
Out of the trickling chamber, SOMEONE peers into it.
SOMEONE blows on her hands.
SOMEONE hugs SOMEONE.
Later in the cauldron chamber, SOMEONE hangs from a rope and harness. The others watch him through the oval hole.
He goes to another ledge below.
Water rains down on him. SOMEONE feeds out some slack.
To some coiled rope on his hip. The young man scans the chamber walls.
Down at the churning pool, gets a hold on the wall, and leans out far under a light waterfall.
SOMEONE gives him some more slack and SOMEONE repositions himself on the ledge.
He extends his left foot to another crag about three feet away.
He feeds him a few more inches. SOMEONE finds a secure position and studies the wall.
He keep kimself onto the ledge.
Water splashes from below.
SOMEONE looks up from the ledge below.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE on the other side.
SOMEONE shines a flashlight on her.
Now, as SOMEONE coils a handful of rope, he glances at SOMEONE who stares off with a stunned gaze, his head propped on his hand.
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a disbelieving glance. SOMEONE sets down his ropes and looks across the way.
His son sits on a ledge, his mouth set in a line and his eyes staring blankly. SOMEONE's chest heaves.
SOMEONE glares at him.
Tears stream down SOMEONE's cheeks.
His face hardens.
SOMEONE glances away.
SOMEONE's brow furrows.
SOMEONE meets his gaze and holds it.
He sits on a ledge below Josh's, resting his hands on his knee.
He shifts his eyes.
Under his father's steady gaze, SOMEONE's chin trembles. His face contorts in anguish.
SOMEONE moves to his son's ledge and crouches. He places a hand on SOMEONE's shoulder.
He rubs his cheek.
Pulling SOMEONE close, he hugs him.
Squeezes his eyes shut.
SOMEONE glares at the father and son.
Shifting his jaw, SOMEONE pulls away.
He meets his father's gaze and nods.
SOMEONE stumbles as he makes his way over the uneven ground.
Trudging past stalagmites, he and SOMEONE find an underwater cave on the opposite side of the chamber. At the water's edge, SOMEONE bends at the waist, resting his hands on his legs.
As they stare at the dark water, SOMEONE joins them.
He scans the submerged cave, then takes off his bag and lets it fall to the ground.
He dives into the water.
As SOMEONE swims around a corner in a narrow passageway, SOMEONE catches up and grabs on to his leg.
But finds the cave ceiling above, holding him underwater.
His hands feeling for a break in the rock.
SOMEONE eyes the water surface.
Path of light pierces the darkness at the cave's entrance and he swims toward it.
His own headlamp off his helmet and replaces it with his son's.
SOMEONE shifts his somber eyes.
SOMEONE stares off.
SOMEONE's lips spread into a smile and he nods.
He gives a wide grin.
SOMEONE looks away.
Pushing out his jaw, he gives a thoughtful look, then abruptly shifts his gaze to a section of the cave's wall near SOMEONE. He stands, sniffing the air.
SOMEONE watches his son head to an eye-level cavity in the rock.Reaching inside, SOMEONE touches a dark, muddy substance, then lifts his fingers to his nose.
Smiling, he turns to his father and smears some of the sludge on his cheek. SOMEONE looks up.
He joins SOMEONE by the cavity.
Self into the hole.
Later, he and SOMEONE climb a narrow gap between two rock faces, pressing their backs to one and gripping the other with their hands and feet.
Lifting his foot, SOMEONE finds a hold.
SOMEONE grabs a piece of jutting rock.
SOMEONE straightens, pushing himself higher.
SOMEONE rests his back on the rock.
He leans against his arm.
Drops of water splash against their helmets, SOMEONE turns to his father and meets his gaze with a broad grin.
He blinks against the falling water, his chest heaving. As his son's light glows on his face, SOMEONE looks away and swallows.
He resumes climbing.
The climbers' lights as they ascend the narrow chimney.
His body to bridge the gap.
With a hand gripping each rock face, SOMEONE steps on to his father's thigh,
body, and grabs a ledge. SOMEONE grits his teeth as SOMEONE's weight bears down on him.
SOMEONE pulls himself onto the ledge.
The light on SOMEONE's helmet torch fades out.
He checks for his light's reflection on his palm.
SOMEONE lifts his hand to the light on his own helmet and switches it off.
Darkness envelopes the climbers.
Now, SOMEONE's helmet light emerges from darkness, illuminating the walls of a tunnel as he crawls through it.
Follows without a light, his figure disappearing in the blackness behind his father.
Ahead, the walls of the tunnel widen and the ceiling rises slightly.
As SOMEONE moves forward, his light fades out.
He turns on his wristwatch's light and it glows on his determined face. Holding its button down, he creeps forward, no longer crawling but crouched under the low ceiling.
He stumbles, then winces and stops walking.
SOMEONE pauses beside him and SOMEONE shoots him a glance.
He lowers himself to the ground and leans against the tunnel's wall, then releases the button for his watch light.
As SOMEONE lifts his hand, a trace of light reflects on his palm and fingers.
He shifts his gaze to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE looks at his son, his profile traced in a glimmer of light. The climber stare down the tunnel where more light gleams of its jagged walls.
Daylight bathes their faces as they emerge from a fissure and step into a cavern.
At its center, a brilliant shaft of sunlight glows down through a hole in its high ceiling.
As they walk toward it, SOMEONE removes his helmet.
SOMEONE removes his helmet as well and his father lifts his face to the hole. Insects flutter around the blazing sunbeam.
Above ground, vegetation lines the hole's perimeter.
SOMEONE lowers his gaze from the natural skylight and notices a weathered military vehicle sitting below it.
SOMEONE climbs on to the tank.
He peers down its hatch, then straightens.
Rain falls on SOMEONE's face as he looks up.
Leaps off the tank, landing in soft, muddy ground. Together, he and SOMEONE crouch and examine some skeletal remains.
Later, a view through the skylight shows towering trees below a cloudy sky. Pale light glimmers on raindrop
as they fall into the cavern. Squatting, SOMEONE fills a container with oil from the tank, then looks over at SOMEONE who strikes a flint under the shelter of a wheel well. He lights a makeshift torch then grins.
As SOMEONE rises with his flaming cylindrical container in hand, SOMEONE shoves fabric into the top of his own oil-filled container.
SOMEONE lights his father's torch with his own and they lift them as if toasting.
With a thoughtful frown, SOMEONE glances at his father.
Now, a wide view shows pale light shining through the hole casting the cavern in a purple-tinged glow.
Holding his makeshift torch, SOMEONE glances around and follows his son into a tunnel. As the light from his flame disappears, our view glides to writing etched in the side of the tank, "Frank and SOMEONE were here. See ya."
Later, orange light from SOMEONE's torch flickers on the rock walls as he leads his father through the tunnel. It widens and he climbs down a ledge, his eyes squinting into a dim chamber.
Smiling, he crouches beside a body of water.
Slipping, SOMEONE slides down the ledge on his rear.
SOMEONE looks over.
SOMEONE rises and SOMEONE shifts his helmet as his son follows the river.
Now with their torches held out, the climbers take careful steps shuffling across muddy ground.
Looking down, SOMEONE pauses and furrows his brow. He crouches to examine some abandoned gear.
He glances at SOMEONE who drops his supply bag and crouches by the equipment as well. Setting down his torch, he checks a gauge.
He test a dive light.
Now, SOMEONE's feet splash in shallow water as they hike into another chamber.
Their light shine on SOMEONE.
Smeared in dirt, SOMEONE grins as he crawls over to them. SOMEONE glares down at him.
SOMEONE rolls his eyes.
He gives SOMEONE a frenzied look.
SOMEONE sets down his bag and SOMEONE rummages through it, finding a bag of food.
Turning away from SOMEONE, SOMEONE moves through the chamber, his eyes scanning the ground.
SOMEONE's light falls on SOMEONE's body, her eyes staring lifelessly.
SOMEONE's expression crumbles and SOMEONE turns to see SOMEONE's pale and swollen face.
Dribbles a handful of dried food into his mouth.
Gaze at SOMEONE's discarded rebreather pack, SOMEONE finds three light sticks inside.
As SOMEONE shoves more food into his mouth, SOMEONE rises.
SOMEONE watches them leave.
SOMEONE's eyes widen and his grip goes slack.
Man panting beside him.
Shaking his head, SOMEONE returns to his back, his hand pressed to his son's cheek.
SOMEONE pats SOMEONE's hand.
Young man turns to see SOMEONE rising to his feet nearby holding a glow stick.
SOMEONE glares. SOMEONE averts his gaze, giving a dumbfounded shake of his head. As SOMEONE trembles
on the ground struggling to breath, SOMEONE watches, heaving a sigh. Tears well in his eyes.
As SOMEONE steps away, SOMEONE's glare follows him.
SOMEONE shrugs with resignation, shaking his head at the cave walls. He dives into the pool and disappears.
SOMEONE stares after him.
His father's side, SOMEONE drops to his knees and cradles his head in his hand.
SOMEONE grimaces.
SOMEONE lowers him into the pool.
Gently supports SOMEONE's head.
SOMEONE lies flat, buoyed by the water.
Sobbing, SOMEONE shakes his head.
As SOMEONE's hand grips his son's arm, SOMEONE's lips tremble.
Meanwhile in the underwater cave, SOMEONE, illuminated by the green light of the glow stick feels his way along the rocks above with clenched teeth.
Emerging in open water, he does a breaststroke toward the murky
Back in the cave, the oil candle's flame slowly extinguishes, leaving the area in darkness.
Break in half, bathing everything in a green glow. He sets the stick aside as his father shivers in the water.
Nods slowly. SOMEONE's pursed lips form a brief, loving smile.
He sets his jaw.
SOMEONE lays his forearm below SOMEONE's chin and gently applies pressure.
Underwater, a flurry of bubbles rises. SOMEONE struggles to hold back sobs.
Now in slow motion, submerged under gently lapping ripples, SOMEONE's grip loosens on his son.
SOMEONE looks down at him, lips parted.
He withdraws his hand from his father's, letting it fall back into the murk.
SOMEONE's right hand half-rises from the cloudy water. Sliding his hand from his father's forehead, SOMEONE lifts his body to the surface.
Under the green illumination of the glow stick, the young man blinks, gazing sadly.
With one hand pressed to his father's chest, SOMEONE bends down and plants a tender kiss on his forehead.
He rises, drawing his arms back and allows his father's body to float away.
Now underwater, SOMEONE emerges from a cavern, clutching a glow stick and the air cylinder.
Rise from the valve as he raises it to his lips and takes a hit.
SOMEONE inhales once again from the tank.
Coming out from around a bulging rock, he sees SOMEONE's body wedged against the ceiling up ahead.
SOMEONE crawls over jagged rocks beneath SOMEONE's lifeless, dangling arms.
Now, SOMEONE arrives at a narrow crevasse.
He takes another hit from the tank, then continues on.
Further on, SOMEONE stares resolutely forward as he feels his way along the jagged.
Glow stick dies out.
Now, SOMEONE clutches the boar tooth torch which emits a soft, warm glow.
Kicking his flippers, he continues on along a rocky passage.
As SOMEONE squeezes through a small opening, he raises the canister valve.
Narrow as he furiously twist the nozzle, then discards the tank.
With his cheeks puffed out, he edges his way up along a jutting wall of rock.
These bubbles emerge from small craters. SOMEONE crawls over and presses his lips to one.
From above, SOMEONE's face breaks the water's surface.
Inhales deeply from another air bubble.
A distant bluish light expands and shines across the big shape of SOMEONE's body.
Wincing, he re-submerges with a shake of his head.
As his near-motionless body rotates underwater, the young man shuts his eyes.
He begins to sink downward.
His body wavers.
Now, SOMEONE appears wearing his helmet light.
He smiles.
A view from underwater reveals shafts of light breaking on the pool's surface, cutting through the murk from a crevasse above.
Now, in a club, two women in old-fashioned costumes perform a traditional dance with fans in front of a DJ.
Amid dancing guests, Sebastian and SOMEONE chat with their boss and a grey-haired man.
Outside, a young woman in a bulky knit cap with a pompom on top makes a call on her cellphone.
She wears her hair loose around her round, soft features.
She looks up at the club with a furrowed brow.
The young woman heaves a grim sigh.
Her eyes fixed on the club, she lowers the phone sadly.
Now, traffic speeds along an overpass beneath the dark nighttime sky.
In the far right lane,
the casually dressed young woman rides a bicycle.
Her feet work the pedals in a steady rhythm,
her tasseled scarf billowing behind her.
At a turn, she narrowly avoids a bus and a taxi.
Her front wheel weaves unsteadily along the pavement.
As cars whisk past at high speed, she reaches a busy street.
As we ride with her, the vehicles blur and distort.
Flashing headlights fill our view.
Now, we gaze out over the city.
In a dark bedroom, a cellphone lights up on a night stand.
In bed, SOMEONE nestles close to Sebastian.
She stirs, wakes, and picks up the cellphone.
The young woman glances at her sleeping partner as she answers.
SOMEONE gets up.
Subtitles. Miss SOMEONE is on her bike and was hit by a taxi.
SOMEONE anxiously ends the call. Daytime.
We gaze past the Oriental Pearl Tower and the adjacent Huangpu River to the hazy city.
Traffic moves smoothly along the streets. At Hongking Hospital, SOMEONE bumps into a nurse.
Reaching a hall, she peers down one end.
Looking the other way, she breaks into a jog and joins a tall woman.
The woman faces a window to a room.
Following her gaze, SOMEONE finds an unconscious SOMEONE covered in casts and bandages.
SOMEONE enters the room and leans over the injured woman.
She reaches down to touch her but her hand hovers inches away.
SOMEONE straightens and shifts on her feet.
She brings the back of her hand to her mouth and squeezes her eyes shut.
Swaying unsteadily, she turns away.
SOMEONE leans against the bed rail in a grief-stricken slouch.
Later, she sits by a window.
She stares vacantly.
In a sunlit living room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE dance around as teenagers. Words appear.
1997, Shanghai.
Clad in matching red and white tracksuits, they snack on buns out of a brown paper bag.
An elegant older woman marches in.
She takes the bag and holds it up.
SOMEONE timidly avoids her gaze.
She takes SOMEONE's hand. The girl yanks it free.
The stepmother faces SOMEONE's friend.
She marches out.
SOMEONE starts to follow, but SOMEONE discreetly steps in her path.
SOMEONE slips past her, gazing after the older woman.
Facing SOMEONE, she sticks out her tongue.
Her friends nods and gives her an encouraging push.
Now, SOMEONE's stepmother plays a record.
Leaving the turntable, she starts to cross the tastefully decorated room.
She pauses and faces her guest.
Leaning against a far wall,
SOMEONE reluctantly shuffles over to the older woman.
As she gets closer, she stares at the floor.
The stepmother moves in close.
A smart girl like you with a bright future shouldn't have to spend all your time with her.
The stepmother leans in intimidatingly, a SOMEONE smile plastered on her exquisitely made up features.
As she speaks, SOMEONE stares at her stained teeth and painted lips.
Now, we peer out a window.
SOMEONE's eyes rise into view and she peeks inside.
She scans the area carefully.
She slips a note in between the pane and the sill, and gently pounds the window frame.
With a faint mischievous smirk, she sinks out of view.
Now huddled by the window, SOMEONE opens the note.
The SOMEONE characters translate to "Come and meet my family for dinner".
SOMEONE beams softly, folds the note shut, and gazes out the window with a hopeful smile.
Now, the two friends walk down a narrow alley.
Holding SOMEONE's hand, SOMEONE leads her through a doorway and across a small courtyard.
Now, at a humble kitchen table.
SOMEONE's father smiles with the girls.
Her mother brings a small pot and lifts the lid. SOMEONE inhales the steam.
SOMEONE serves her friend a dumpling.
Now, a long reed with a heavy bud at the end taps on SOMEONE's window.
Clutching it, SOMEONE also holds an umbrella.
A pretty, young woman opens the window and the girl ducks down.
Sitting close to her aunt, SOMEONE notices an antique slipper the size of a small child's foot.
Three-inch golden lilies.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a look.
They hook pinkies. Now, at a modest office,
a man at a desk hands the girls a CD case.
SOMEONE takes up a pen and signs the bottom.
She passes the contract to SOMEONE, who adds her signature.
In the present day, SOMEONE sits by SOMEONE's hospital bed, thoughtfully reading through some papers as sunlight pours in through the windows.
A woman in a white coat arrives.
SOMEONE's bag is at reception.
SOMEONE smiles politely and the hospital staffer goes.
The young professional flips through a few more papers, then flips their binder shut.
Now, SOMEONE's hand gingerly pulls open a large black leather satchel and finds the items within encased in clear plastic bags.
she finds a stack of orange and white note cards.
SOMEONE sets it aside with a puzzled frown.
Digging deeper in the satchel, she pulls out a dark gray garment.
She takes part of it from its plastic encasement.
It looks like a man's suit jacket.
SOMEONE's brow furrows and she continues sorting through her friend's belongings.
Next, she pulls out a manuscript.
She takes it from its bag and holds it up with a frown.
The cover page reads simply "Untitled by SOMEONE Liao".
SOMEONE flips through the pages and reads silently.
This is the story of SOMEONE and SOMEONE,
two girls born in the same month, on the same day.
Their feet bound on the same day.
Now, SOMEONE drives.
SOMEONE comes to a stop.
She notices a little girl in a blue tunic sitting nearby.
She wears her bangs short, the rest of her hair in a long braid.
She faces SOMEONE, her bare feet resting on a stool.
Hands wrap a black swath of fabric over the girl's toes and pulls hard.
Another adult firmly holds the tearful recoiling girl's shoulder as the person continues binding her feet.
The girl looks to the woman holding her shoulder.
In another home, a woman squeezes a little girl's toes together as she tightly wraps a bandage around the child's foot.
The girl bites her lip, her eyes filling with tears, and shoots a pleading glance at a stern-faced woman watching them.
The stern-faced woman stares down at the seated girl.
The child blinks and the woman lifts her to her feet.
With her lips parted in pain,
the little girl faces a pair of doors. She takes a step, then hunches over.
Hobbling forward, the little girl tries to run outside.
A lady servant stops her.
SOMEONE takes small steps.
Only through pain SOMEONE you find beauty.
Only through suffering SOMEONE you find peace.
With SOMEONE and her mother.
She extends her hand.
SOMEONE takes a few small slow steps.
Her mother grabs her hand and pulls her forward.
SOMEONE pushes on.
As the little girl turns and hobbles in the other direction,
her mother gives a gentle push.
Crisscrossed bandages around SOMEONE's ankles hold her bindings tight.
Now, in bed, SOMEONE thrashes under her covers.
Meanwhile, at her home, SOMEONE whimpers as she lies under a blanket on the floor.
Turning onto her other side, she faces a sleeping sibling.
One of SOMEONE's bound feet gets out below her blanket, its bandage is stained with blood.
A crowd watches as porters carry a sedan chair into their neighborhood.
SOMEONE's mother and father wait just outside their home.
SOMEONE stands in the doorway with a servant.
A plump woman dressed in a colorful SOMEONE robe pushes aside the curtain on the enclosed litter and steps out.
Later, she examines SOMEONE's tiny, stunted foot inside her lotus shoe.
She leans on her cane and eyes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE blinks her solemn eyes at the matchmaker.
The plump woman nods, then turns to the door.
A servant places the privileged girl in a seat beside her new laotong.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE both stare straight ahead for a long moment, then, in unison, shift their curious eyes toward each other.
Now, they write at a table.
SOMEONE gazes across the table at SOMEONE's paper.
Later, as the girls lie in bed together, SOMEONE traces characters on SOMEONE's bare back.
Now, side by side at a water basin, they wipe their faces with wash cloths.
The water reflects their images. SOMEONE with buns on either side of her head,
SOMEONE with her simple braid.
Snowflakes drift down and the girls try to catch them.
Now, they kneel at a shrine.
The Temple of Gupo Fair is a holy place. We are here today in front of Gupo to write your laotong contract and make your vows of eternal commitment.
She opens a fan with writing on it. The girls read.
The matchmaker closes the fan.
Now, the girls write side by side, their eyes intent on their careful brush strokes.
they set their papers in a fire.
The matchmaker bows.
In the present, SOMEONE sits at SOMEONE's bedside, gazing at her unconscious friend.
A bedside lamp shines its harsh light on SOMEONE's bruised face.
SOMEONE shifts her woeful eyes to her own lap and tilts her head thoughtfully.
Her gaze drifts to SOMEONE's hand which rests over.
Sliding her own hand on top of her laotong's, SOMEONE gives it a gentle squeeze.
She clutches SOMEONE's limp hand between both of hers,
then rests her cheek against them and closes her eyes.
Now, at a restaurant.
SOMEONE sits across a table from her parents.
Her mother pauses as she eats, frowning at her daughter's sullen downcast gaze.
She gives her parents a determined look.
SOMEONE sits at her car, staring off absently.
She takes out her phone and dials.
She lifts it to her ear and waits.
She hangs up.
Now, at her apartment, a pile of pages from SOMEONE's manuscript rests on a couch.
SOMEONE sits beside it. The remaining pages settled on her crossed leg.
With her elbow on the arm of the couch, she props her cheek on her hand as she reads.
In the story, SOMEONE, now a young woman, brushes characters onto a panel of a paper fan.
With a thoughtful smile, SOMEONE finishes writing and props her cheek on her hand.

The privileged young woman gives her friend a sly smile and averts her gaze.
Now alone together, they arrange a bouquet.
SOMEONE stares at her worried friend, who clutches her hand.
She tries to stifle a chuckle.
SOMEONE shoves her friend, then allows a smile.
Now, in the daytime, a procession of women with their faces hidden behind red scarves exit SOMEONE's home through a doorway adorned on each side with a red banner.
Behind them, SOMEONE holds SOMEONE's arm and guides her outside.
A red scarf hangs over SOMEONE's bridal crown,
veiling her face.
With SOMEONE at her side, the bride takes cautious steps over the threshold, then stops in front of her parents.
She eyes her daughter through the red veil.
She bows her head. SOMEONE starts to guide the bride away, but SOMEONE stops.
SOMEONE tugs on her arm,
but her laotong remains in place.
SOMEONE turns back to her parents.
With SOMEONE tugging her arm, SOMEONE reluctantly moves on, but her face remains turned toward her cheerful mother.
The two friends walk past townsfolk gathered to watch the procession, then stop at a gateway in a brick wall that encloses the property.
Standing there, Madame SOMEONE gives SOMEONE an expectant look.
The young bride turns to her laotong, the beaded fringe on her veil swaying back and forth.
Reaching into the loose sleeve of her robe, SOMEONE withdraws a folded paper fan and holds it out to her friend.
SOMEONE takes it, then lifts her gaze to her laotong's.
SOMEONE helps her slide the fan down her own sleeve.
She rests her hand on the bride's.
SOMEONE pushes aside her veil's fringe.
Her friend grabs her wrist and lowers her hand from the veil.
Swallowing, SOMEONE gives her laotong a sad look.
Still clutching the bride's hands, she glances into the street,
where musicians play by a waiting sedan chair.
Smoke billows into the air as firecrackers pop.
Now, SOMEONE sits at the edge of a curtained state bed, her hands folded in her lap.
A young man walks over and lifts off her veil, revealing her elaborate bridal crown.
A mountain of fruit rests on top, and a second veil of dangling beads offers a semi-obscured view of her nervous face.
As the groom sits beside his new bride, she scoots a few inches away from him.
He lowers his disappointed gaze, then shoots her a tentative glance.
He gently grabs the skirt of her robe
closed together tightly.
SOMEONE blinks behind the beaded fringe of her bridal crown as her husband kneels and lifts her tiny foot.
He lowers his face to her red lotus shoe.
Closing his eyes, he gently kisses and caresses her foot.
SOMEONE tries to pull it away, but he holds tight.
He kisses her instep again.
SOMEONE withdraws and he glances up at her.
Sitting up next to his bride again, he tosses his braid over his shoulder and grabs her hand.
SOMEONE tries to pull it away but he holds firm.
Avoiding his gaze, she stops struggling and blinks resignedly.
One year later. An elderly couple sits on either side of a table facing us. The man lights a pipe.
Standing in a hallway, a pregnant SOMEONE eavesdrops on the conversation.
She exits the room and sees SOMEONE.
She exits past her shy daughter-in-law.
Later, SOMEONE folds a robe in her bedroom while her husband pours tea at a small table.
SOMEONE shifts her concerned gaze away.
With his eyes averted from his wife, he takes a sip of tea.
He rests the cup just below his lips as he swallows, then turns to SOMEONE with a furrowed brow and finds her gazing at him.
She lowers her solemn eyes.
Now in the present. SOMEONE shifts her handbag's shoulder strap as she climbs some steps leading to a set of glass doors.
IPushing one open, she enters an art gallery. n the foyer, a well-dressed man sits at a table covered in artwork.
He chats with another man.
With a nod, she heads back to an exhibit room where she finds a gallery worker hanging black and white images of disfigured feet on a crisp white wall.
Walking deeper into the room, SOMEONE eyes a display podium holding pairs of tiny lotus shoes.
On another wall, a drawing of a fan sits below writing in images detailing Chinese tradition.
SOMEONE examines real paper fans sitting atop a row of display podiums.
She gazes at the writing on the spread panels of one.
A short-haired woman dressed in all black
with a straight line of bangs over her eyebrows approaches.
SOMEONE notices a projection on a wall.
Moving closer to the bright panel, she sees rows of Chinese characters.
As a gallery worker scrolls through text on a laptop,
the projected image moves as well.
This is a new interactive nu shu program.
As Claire scrolls downs the rows of characters on a second laptop,
SOMEONE gazes at the projection.
The light casts a pale glow on her delicate face.
Now, SOMEONE opens a jewelry box drawer and takes out a paper fan.
Later, she sits at a table and writes on it.
A baby rests beside her in a bassinet.
Spreading open the fan, SOMEONE reads her friend's message.
Now, SOMEONE's mother-in-law sits at the head of the table of a group of women doing embroidery work.
Her mother-in-law's eyes remain on her stitching.
SOMEONE blinks, then averts her heartbroken gaze.
She looks up at her mother-in-law, who turns to her with an unyielding expression.

Steam wafts out.
Later, SOMEONE paces with hobbled steps and wrings her hands as she waits in a dim hallway.
A servant girl rushes over.
SOMEONE slides the folded fan out from her sleeve.
She places SOMEONE's hands around it.
The servant girl nods.
Clutching the fan to her chest,
she cautiously glances around, then hurries off down the hall.
SOMEONE watches her disappear down a staircase,
then turns her look.
Now, SOMEONE pushes open a gate's wooden doors. Hurrying to a sedan chair, she takes SOMEONE's arm as the woman exits the litter.
A porter tilts it forward,
allowing her to step over the wooden rails in front.
SOMEONE accompanies her through the open gate.
SOMEONE makes her way across a bridge outside a temple, then turns to the young servant.
As SOMEONE returns to the gate,
a woman approaches SOMEONE.
SOMEONE joyfully clasps her hands around her friend's.
Now, they each add a fresh stick of incense to a pot filled with the smoldering tokens.
The two friends kneel, press their hands together in prayer, and bow their heads.
Later, they sit on a bench.
Her head hung low, SOMEONE nods morosely.
SOMEONE glances at her troubled friend, then takes her hands and shifts her gaze straight ahead.
SOMEONE lifts her eyes to her laotong's calm face and twitches a tender smile.
Now, a door closes SOMEONE into a room.
SOMEONE sinks to her knees. With an anguished look, she peers through a crack, then slumps against the thick wooden door.
In the present, as SOMEONE sits asleep with her head propped against a wall, a female hand reaches out and gently brushes her long bangs from her face then taps her shoulder.
SOMEONE wakes and looks up at the visitor.
SOMEONE's aunt sits beside her on a bench in the hallway.
She lets out a breath.
SOMEONE glances at her ashamedly.
She watches sympathetically as SOMEONE hangs her head.
SOMEONE lowers her gaze and stares at the floor, lost in thought.
Our view gently drifts toward her worried face framed by thin strands of her raven hair.
Now, SOMEONE sits alone at a table.
She dips a brush in ink, then begins to write on a fan spread open before her.
In another room, an old man lies on his side, smoking a long-stemmed pipe.
SOMEONE spies on him from a cracked open door.
Our view drifts from the old man's pinched, intoxicated face to the pipe in his hand and a burning opium lamp nearby.
SOMEONE shuts the door.
The image dissolves to SOMEONE as she opens the fan to the many columns of Chinese lettering in its folds.
SOMEONE gazes thoughtfully at the message,
then shuts the fan and touches it to her chin.
She dreamily closes her eyes.
As she gently presses the fan to her cheek, the image fades to black.
Now, two years later.
Our view drifts from an open burning stove to SOMEONE,
who stares off thoughtfully with an infant strapped to her back.

On this day of the new year, we became Master and Lady SOMEONE.
A second couple bows to them and walks off.
The center portion of her lips painted red, SOMEONE wears an elegant black silk robe with a royal blue yoke and elaborate silver jewelry.
She maintains an emotionless expression as the villagers continue to pay their respects.

She peers out the passenger window.
Passing some scaffolding and a few partly torn down buildings,
she spots a few distant skyscrapers and a tall crane beyond the rundown neighborhood.

The noblewoman sits up, her long hair loose around her shoulder.
She peers down toward the lower floor, then shifts her puzzled gaze and gets up.

Patting the boy's hand, he pauses.
The father lays a hand on his son's head, then touches his face.
The child lies unresponsive.
The butcher lowers the blanket and cranes his face close to the boy's.
The father sits back on his knees.
He hefts the boy's limp body and rocks him in his arms.
As he gets to his feet, his son's head rolls back limply and one arm dangles from his grasp.
The butcher clasps his son tightly to his chest.

Staggering slightly, he plods away from the others.
Behind him, SOMEONE wakes to see her husband grimacing skyward.

Her melancholy face falling out of view.
SOMEONE looks on mournfully.
In the present, SOMEONE lies draped over SOMEONE's hospital bed,
sleeping with her hand over some of the manuscript pages.
Daylight from the windows accentuates her pale complexion as she slumbers.
A few stray wisps of her black hair obscure her delicate face,
which rests on her own outstretched arm.
Her jackets hangs slung over her chair's backrest
and her right hand clutches a few more pages.
The rest of the stack lies on SOMEONE's blanketed lap.
SOMEONE slumbers on.
Nearby, a monitor tracks her friend's vitals.
At night, in SOMEONE's car.
Staring off, she shifts her attention to the traffic ahead and pulls her car forward.
Now, we gaze at a Shanghai freeway from a distance.
The tightly-packed headlights shine brightly beneath the night sky.
Beyond them, a vast mass of skyscrapers stands mostly darkened.
Now, in a club.
A girlish singer in a slinky black dress leaves the stage and flirts with patrons on the dance floor.
On the periphery, a ruggedly handsome man of Anglo descent sports close cropped hair and a nice suit.

Now in a dark space,
she opens the fan in a shaft of gentle light and reads.
Three sworn sisters in Jintian have promised to love me as I am.
You need not worry about me anymore.
Now, steam rises from bowls of food on a table.
SOMEONE steps into view, her head jutting forward and her arms at her sides.
She pauses by a window and gazed outward.
Clutching the fan in one hand, she raises it to her waist and rests it on her other palm.
She stares off with a dazed, stricken expression.
Silhouetted against a window, she swallows hard,
then slowly doubles over and grasps a chair at the head of the table.
She sinks down, turning her back to us as she rests her head against her hand.
The fan drops from her grasp.
Now in her apartment, SOMEONE continues reading the manuscript.

In a gathering room, several women sit around a table with a bright red table cloth.
Words appear. Six months later.
The gathered women sew and enjoy refreshments as they sing.
One nods and smiles to SOMEONE, who sits apart.
The noblewoman politely returns the gesture and makes an effort to sing along.
SOMEONE arrives.
She grimly steps away.

Responding to her gregarious Jintian sisters with faint smiles and nods.

The bride, her mother, and a few other guests take notice as she shuffles past the table.

She continues onward, leaving the party.
Now, SOMEONE wanders into the 19th century gathering room.
She stops and turns.
Across the room, SOMEONE sits alone.

Heading further in, she passes a mirror dotted with stickers and photographs.
Exposed wiring drapes across the crumbling brick walls.
SOMEONE passes a half-finished painting on an easel,
then a low unmade bed tucked in a corner.
Later, she sits at a desk littered with several stacks of books, manuscripts, and documents.
SOMEONE flips through the pages of a small spiral bound notebook.
We drift closer to her and find her lips slightly pursed as she reads.
In the notebook, a pen and ink sketch depicts a delicate tree amidst a desolate landscape.
On the opposite page, an illustration shows light from an oncoming train shining brightly from a round tunnel.
SOMEONE turns to the next page
and finds it filled with writing.
Near the back cover, she discovers a folded letter addressed to her.
We see SOMEONE sitting in a red tinted bathtub. she sinks down slowly under the water.
Back at the desk, Shutting the notebook,

The finely-tailored garment unfolds gracefully as she holds it up.
Standing, she puts it on.
She wraps it tightly around her slender torso and hugs it close over her chest.
Her head droops forward and her eyes close as she strolls over to a sunny window.
She sways dreamily on her feet, then lifts her head and slips her hands into the pockets with a heavy sigh.
Looking down, she pulls out a small brass key with a circular toggle
and a small, round plastic coil.
SOMEONE frowns quizzically as she turns it in her fingertips.
Now, a pair of wood-framed glass doors bear stenciled Chinese characters.
Reversed letters beneath read "Yangtze Bath".

His locker number is 173.
The burly bathhouse attendant stops eating and listens with a lifted brow.
We're not open yet. They're still cleaning.
Leading her into a room, he turns to a worker.
The worker stops spreading towels over loungers and leaves.
SOMEONE gives a tiny bow and the man returns the gesture.
She waits as he heads off.
She makes her way to a bank of wooden lockers and skims her gaze over their numbers.
she slides the key into its lock and pulls open the door.
she finds a modest shrine in memory of SOMEONE's father.
A rectangular wooden plaque stands upright
bearing the man's photo and a panel of Chinese writing.
A few blue silk roses and pieces of citrus surround it.
SOMEONE lifts a folded fan of the locker's shelf.
She opens it, spreading its creased paper panels and finds writing on each one.
Flipping it over, she sees writing on only half of the back panels.
She blinks her sad eyes and closes the fan. 
Her gaze falls on something else in the locker and she tilts her head for a better look. 
On the bottom shelf, she finds a stack of typed pages.
Taking them out, she reads the cover page "SnowFlower And The Secret Fan."
SOMEONE flips to the next page and reads,
her intent eyes fixed on her friend's completed manuscript.
The end of this story is about things of the heart that SOMEONE never change.
Within the story, a girl stands in the doorway of SOMEONE's home.

Gazing up at her, SOMEONE's daughter grimaces woefully.
A tear slides down her cheek.
SOMEONE kneels down to the girl.
But she has other sisters.
She has no other sisters. She misled you.

For ten years, she was only their teacher.

The girl's face crumbles in sobs as she grabs SOMEONE's hands.
SOMEONE averts her gaze.
SOMEONE gazes off sadly.
Now, in a modest bedroom, SOMEONE lies on a sleeping platform with her hands folded on her chest.
Three women at her bedside leave.
As SOMEONE enters, SOMEONE's eyes remain closed.

Later, in SOMEONE's bedroom, golden light shines through the windows,
casting a warm glow on SOMEONE's face.
She gazes at SOMEONE, who lies peacefully by with her eyes closed and her hands folded on her stomach.
Now, SOMEONE leans over her sister,
letting her face hover just inches from SOMEONE's.
She extends her trembling fingers and rests them upon her laotong's cheek.
Now, tears shine in SOMEONE's eyes as she stares off with a distant expression.
When SOMEONE returned home after SOMEONE's funeral,
she looked at the fan and could not allow things to end as they had,
so she opened a new panel,
dipped her brush, and wrote a final inscription.
As a tear runs down SOMEONE's cheek,
she calmly works a bamboo stylus on a panel of the open fan,
leaving several characters in black ink.
In the present, SOMEONE reads the manuscript page with doleful eyes.
Still clutching the folded fan,
she lowers the sheet of paper and stares off.
An aerial view focuses on gleaming traffic and crowded highway lanes.
The world is always changing.
Every day it's changing.
Everything in life is changing.
We have to look inside ourselves to find what stays the same.

As SOMEONE lies shoulder to shoulder with SOMEONE,
the injured woman's eyelids slowly lift.

SOMEONE turns away and pads toward the doors. They swing shut by themselves.
He returns to SOMEONE and hesitantly picks up the dragon. The sorcerer watches closely. As SOMEONE holds the tiny dragon in his palm, it comes to life, sleepily shakes its head, and flaps its metal wings.
It crawls to the back,
A green gemstone studs its back.
Now, SOMEONE hurries downstairs into a basement. He kneels in front of the brick supporting the stairs and waves his hands. A red veneer crumbles away, revealing ancient darker bricks beneath. 
SOMEONE studies his dragon ring, turning it to catch the light. With each movement, boxes on a high shelf quake. SOMEONE jerks his hand to one side and the boxes tumble off the shelf. As he makes a light knocking motion, a wall buckles.

She looks away. With a nod, SOMEONE turns to head off, then turns back and furrows his brow. The woman's blue eyes briefly meet his gaze.
She nods.
She blinks confusedly.
Now in a posh apartment, the SOMEONE Dynasty urn stands by a hall doorway. As a gray-haired man passes, the urn quivers. The man returns and stares at it. The urn's side depicts the fighting sorcerers. Meanwhile,

At the school a teen girl comes outside in her cap and gown and joins two fellow graduates.
In the art room, SOMEONE stands with his graduation robe slung over one arm. On the easel, his painting offers a portrait of SOMEONE in
tints of green and purple.
The subject gazes off with a stoic expression hinting at wisdom beyond her years. Turning away, SOMEONE sets his diploma and graduation robes on a chair.

He goes to the archway and briefly surveys the room before kneeling at the foot of the bed.
Catching sight of his reflection in a mirror,
the prowler walks up to an open closet door.
He slowly pulls it closed as he checks behind it.
His face obscured by a ball cap, the menacing man turns. He heads toward a beaded curtain and parts it.

He flips on a light and paces tensely around the space.
The sweaty killer's gaze darts wildly about.
He stares downward by the door and stills himself.
SOMEONE glances up and across the room.
As he walks away from the door, our view shifts to reveal a pink twin bed covered in blood.

faces the red eyed, blue skinned leader of the frost giants.

The king stands and thumps his spear on the floor.
For below the throne room in the heart of the palace, two guards wearing yellow capes march up a corridor with smooth stone walls.
Various artifacts sit in recesses along the hall.
The guards approach the glowing blue box which rests upon a pedestal of scored rock at the end of the corridor.
Hidden in shadows, a blue hand slides across a thick column, leaving a thin layer of frost.

With a panoply of stars strewn across the sky behind them,
they gallop along an elevated roadway which resembles a thin ribbon of water suspended in the air.

His daughter watches as he fits the new casserole dish inside.
Sitting at a table in a breakfast nook, he smiles. He watches his daughter spread peanut butter and jelly on slices of 	bread in the adjoining kitchen.

She bags the sandwiches.
Holding a marker, SOMEONE draws a check SOMEONE in the air.
She smiles as she resumes her work.
SOMEONE watches her with an amused loving stare.
On the storage bag's white label, SOMEONE writes PB and a backwards J.
Now, SOMEONE pushes open SOMEONE's bedroom door and finds his son asleep on top of the covers.
The teen's hand rests on a leather-bound book resembling a journal.
Entering the room, SOMEONE gently lifts his son's hand and takes the book.
He sits on the edge of the bed and shoots SOMEONE a perplexed glance.
Furrowing his brow, he opens the book to a pair of skillfully drawn sketches.
One shows a bald burly man with a menacing look
and the other depicts a hollow-cheeked face
with a grim expression.
Dark-smudged pencil work creates gloomy shading around both figures.
Nodding, SOMEONE turns the page. In the next sketch, a boy sits with his elbows on a table, his face buried in his hands.
At the center of the table, tiny people stand around a gaping chasm.
The sketch on the opposite page shows a woman cradling a baby while a figure watches from a doorway.
Flipping to the next two pages,
SOMEONE finds a drawing filling up both sides.
In it, an anguished three-eyed face lets out a scream, its red uvula visible through its gaping mouth. SOMEONE sets 	the sketchbook aside and caresses his son's shaggy brown bangs.
Later in a bathroom, he dabs his mouth with a towel and wipes his hands, then lifts his eyes to a mirror above the 	sink.
He stares at his weary defeated reflection.
He shifts his gaze to a cluster of pill bottles filling a shelf.
The shelf below contains jewelry, knick-knacks, and a framed photo of him and SOMEONE.
SOMEONE lowers his heartbroken eyes.
SOMEONE stands in the doorway.
Picking her up, SOMEONE carries her into her bedroom.

Turning from the window, SOMEONE holds her tighter.

In the back seat, SOMEONE plays with a digital camera.
SOMEONE nods.
SOMEONE eyes the real estate agent thoughtfully, then shrugs his lips in an accepting look.
Now, SOMEONE lifts the camera as they cruise past a Tudor-style house.
SOMEONE flips to another listing in the binder. They drive past a plain-gray, two-story home with red trim.
They pass a cozy-looking white house with an ivy-covered chimney.
Flipping through the binder, SOMEONE furrows his brow. They pull up in front of a ranch-style house with a yard 	covered in native-California plants.
SOMEONE holds out a listing.
They drive up a rustic tree-lined road.
Gazing out her window, SOMEONE smiles. Up ahead, the house lies shrouded behind a cluster of mature trees. A slack-	jawed SOMEONE eyes the large property.
The car parks alongside an old wooden fence. We glimpse the sun through a canopy of tree branches,
then find SOMEONE riding on her father's shoulders, aiming her camera at the quaint two-story Colonial house.
SOMEONE heads inside.
He looks around the spacious, mostly empty rooms.
He follows SOMEONE upstairs.
From a window, she overlooks the countryside.
Startled by the sound, SOMEONE and SOMEONE look around.
Outside, a male lion walks up to a chain-link fence.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the real estate agent watch him from the other side.
SOMEONE looks up at her dad.
He looks at his daughter, who lowers her saddened gaze.
They leave the enclosure.
He looks back, but finds no sign of his daughter.
The real estate agent follows him up a set of stairs set into a hillside.

SOMEONE meets her father's gaze and smiles.
Welling with emotion, SOMEONE beams.
He chuckles to himself, then licks his wide lips.
Glancing back at the lion enclosure, he locks eyes with the big cat. Sunlight glares behind SOMEONE's joyful face. The 	lion's soulful eyes watch him through the chain links. Now, at SOMEONE's Restaurant.

The concerned father returns his attention to the road ahead and notices Little Dom's.
Patrons eat at sidewalk tables outside the corner cafe.
As he drives by, SOMEONE stares at a bank of windows.
We glimpse SOMEONE sitting alone at a booth inside. Her brown eyes find us and she gives a pretty smile.
The SUV now leads the moving truck onto the zoo property. In the back seat, SOMEONE sighs and shifts his unhappy 	gaze. Indoors, a blonde teenage girl attaches light-up letters to a metal frame, which she displays in a window.
SOMEONE halts their vehicle.
The sign reads, Welcome, Brave New Owners.
SOMEONE waves to the blonde girl, who smiles and waves back.
From the back seat, SOMEONE waves as well.
SOMEONE stares curiously at the welcoming stranger inside the restaurant. She moves along the dingy windows, continuing to wave as she watches them drive on.
SOMEONE keeps his eyes on her until a tree finally blocks his view.
Now in a downpour, a burly bearded man in a raincoat pushes a wheelbarrow full of mulch.
A sultry woman stands in an old barn.
She watches the Mees move in.

SOMEONE gives SOMEONE an embarrassed look.
The frizzy-haired man heads off.
SOMEONE shyly averts his gaze.
He moves off.

At night, SOMEONE studies invoices.
Wearing reading glasses, he sits alone, at the end of the dining room table, in front of a laptop, and surrounded by 	bills. He touches his brow as he continues to review the expenses.
His attention drifts to a window.
He goes out onto the porch,
ambles to the railing with his hands stuffed in his pockets, and listens.
He watches the wispy branches of a tree sway in the gentle breeze.
He looks to his left.
He looks to the right, then back at the tree.
Soft moonlight shines on his curious face.
He steps down from the porch.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE lies in bed staring at a framed photo of himself with his mother.
He presses the picture to his chest, and wraps his arms around it, with tears in his eyes.
Now, SOMEONE enters the dim restaurant.
He finds the staff in a dining room, adorned with a framed photo of SOMEONE Warhol, as well as memorabilia of 	MacCready's daredevil past,
including a photo of him giving a lion a ride in a vintage race car.

He pulls out a chair for SOMEONE.
SOMEONE brings him a beer. SOMEONE and SOMEONE play chess at the bar.
The next day, SOMEONE marches up a hill wearing a black skull cap, a tool belt, and brown work boots. He pauses to 	scan his surroundings, then continues on his way. As SOMEONE works on a porcupine enclosure, Crystal hands him a 	tool. SOMEONE interrupts to show him a ledger. SOMEONE enters the enclosure with an armful of posts.

Stickers and stamps on every side read, Caution: Live Snakes.
SOMEONE's hand hovers over its metal latch.

In the restaurant.
SOMEONE and another staffer hold the door shut. Outside, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they wait to greet the 	arriving pickup.

Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE set towering posts near Buster's enclosure. On a monthly calendar, a hand checks off 	the 1st of June. SOMEONE mounts a sign in front of a capuchin enclosure. Later, the hand crosses off June 10th.
As a circular saw cuts a pole, otters watch from a rock.
On the calendar, the hand Xs out the 19th, then adds to a doodle at the bottom. Now, SOMEONE cuts through bars 	on Buster's enclosure.

The submarine shakes, but continues through the water as SOMEONE and his followers reach an all-white state-of-the-art bridge.
Water surges around SOMEONE's head as the vessel drags him in its wake.
On the ship, sailors gather on the decks.
The submarine drags SOMEONE beneath the water.
Completely submerged, he bares his gritted teeth, and keeps a stubborn hold on the submarine.
On the ship, SOMEONE runs along the deck, then dives from the edge. He plunges into the water behind SOMEONE and wraps his arms around him.
Two veins throb in SOMEONE's forehead as SOMEONE drags him toward the surface. In the escaping submarine, SOMEONE shifts his smug gaze.
The two mutants surface.
SOMEONE smiles warmly at him.
The haunted man regards him with a furrowed brow.
As we drift over a sprawling complex, words appear: "Covert CIA Research Base."
On a lawn, a sphere stands on a pedestal, resembling a giant golf ball on a tee.
At a bustling entrance, a black car pulls up.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, the man in black, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE get out.
Now a bespectacled young man shows a model of the stealth jet.
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
The man in black steps closer, his head cocked.
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE.
The slim charmingly disheveled young man shifts his uncertain gaze.
He gives a little shrug of the head, then kicks off his shoes.
He peels off his socks,
revealing large feet with long prehensile toes,
including opposable big toes.
SOMEONE notices the blonde SOMEONE beaming radiantly at him.
He smiles pleasurably, then scoots past the group.
He leaps up, backflips, and catches hold of the model jet with his feet.
He hangs upside down.
He swings gently as his feet grip the model tightly.
He stares, slack-jawed.
Smiling warmly, SOMEONE steps in close to SOMEONE.
Now a TV in a living room shows a news broadcast.
SOMEONE skeptically cocks her head.
SOMEONE crosses to a large hard case sitting on a desk.
He opens it and pulls out a sleek shiny helmet the color of pewter
designed to cover the entire head.
Steel-hued trim frames its specialized facial opening.
He puts it on, leaving only his eyes, nose, mouth, and chin exposed.
As SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, she exhales and lowers her chin.
She stares piercingly at SOMEONE, her eyes narrowing.
Relaxing, she tilts her head and cocks an eyebrow.
SOMEONE beams gratefully.
SOMEONE holds up a glass of liquor.
SOMEONE's smile fade
She takes the glass and crosses the stylish room to a hatch.
Opening the door, she heads into the submarine bridge.
SOMEONE and the cyclone-maker lower a ladder for her.
Now standing in an open upper hatch, SOMEONE's diamond hand cuts a plum-sized chunk of ice from a large formation.
As it plops into SOMEONE's drink,
we drift back and find the sub in the midst of a frozen sea.
In a recess at the lab, SOMEONE sits facing SOMEONE.
SOMEONE leans in close.
She lays her forearm across his lap.
SOMEONE rolls up her sleeve and swabs at a patch of her skin with a cotton ball.
He picks up a syringe and injects the needle into her vein.
SOMEONE winces.
She brings her full parted lips in toward his.
She straightens abruptly as SOMEONE strolls over.
SOMEONE presses his lips shut and swallow
SOMEONE stares after SOMEONE as he saunters off, then faces SOMEONE.
The young man licks his lips and shifts his uneasy gaze.
Now in a dimly lit office, SOMEONE searches a file cabinet.
He brings out a folder, glances over his shoulder, and studies its cover.
It bears the CIA emblem,
SOMEONE's name, and a file number.
SOMEONE puts it in a briefcase.
Later he exits
the complex, passing SOMEONE.
SOMEONE keeps his back to SOMEONE, his gaze vulnerable.
He smiles bitterly.
He faces the compassionate young man.
SOMEONE stands motionless, his wary gaze fixed on SOMEONE.
SOMEONE backs away a few feet, then turns and heads toward the building.
SOMEONE looks away, uncertain.
Now SOMEONE looks at the giant golf-ball-like structure.
SOMEONE smile
With a nod, SOMEONE eyes the man in black.
SOMEONE considers SOMEONE.
The supervising agent gapes.
As the man in black holds SOMEONE's smug gaze, our view zooms out a window, which frames the transmitter.
Now SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE find SOMEONE inside the transmitter's spherical room.
SOMEONE pulls on a helmet attached to a network of wire
SOMEONE flips switches on a control board as SOMEONE waits atop a circular platform at the room's center.
Furrowing his brow, SOMEONE scrutinizes his telepathic colleague.
As SOMEONE closes his eyes, SOMEONE watches with an anxious look.
SOMEONE flips more switches and a strip of paper begins to move like a conveyor belt under the arms of a chart recorder.
White light glows down on SOMEONE.
He clutches railings at his sides. His chest heaves as he envisions shooting into the air past hundreds of humans. Emerging on a blanket of clouds, his gaze sweeps from three girls, to a man reading a book, to a dark-skinned girl with white hair.
He smiles.
SOMEONE finds a girl being examined by an eye doctor.
In the transmitter, SOMEONE watches a printer.
SOMEONE grins.
His mind's eye zooms from person to person in the clouds,
then focuses on a black-haired young woman in booty shoots and a bra with dangling fringe.
The clouds clear away to show her standing on a bar in a night club.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE now sit in front of her.
SOMEONE shows her some money.
Later in a private room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE clink their glasses.
SOMEONE snaps and an ice bucket with champagne rises.
As they look at her, the young woman twitches a smile.
Reaching behind her back,
she unhooks her bra and a web-like tattoo of four dragonfly wings morphs into real ones. As they flutter rapidly, the young woman rises into the air.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE exchange an amazed look, then return their attention to the hovering dancer.
Back at the transmitter, the printer types more coordinates.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb into a cab.
SOMEONE guides the meter's arm down. Later the recruiters walk a prison corridor.
The warden opens a cell.
Sitting on a bench inside, a brawny young man with blonde hair lifts his gaze.
Now in an aquarium, a teenaged boy and girl face a fish tank.
The pretty teen gives him a haughty look.
As she turns away, the shaggy-haired boy blows at the tank.
The water inside ripples, driving the fish off.
The girl turns back to the tank and finds all of the fish gone.
With a perplexed look, she hurries off.
As the boy turns back to the tank, SOMEONE and SOMEONE step up behind him.
Later the recruiters enter a pub where Logan sits at the bar.
They approach the troubled man as he lifts a cigar to his lips.
Logan puffs on his cigar and the two recruiters exchange a resigned look.
As they head out the door, he stares over his shoulder after them, then downs his drink and gestures for another.
Now a view through a periscope sweeps across a vacant ocean.
Inside SOMEONE's sub, SOMEONE removes her eyes from the viewfinder and turns to SOMEONE.
Striding out of the bridge, she enters the adjacent living room and office area.
She opens a small metal box on a desk and pushes a button inside.
Two sections of wall separate to reveal a secret doorway.
Entering a room covered in mirrored panels, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE staring down at a waist-high nuclear reactor.
SOMEONE's chest heaves and his eyes harden.
Now on the steps of the SOMEONE Memorial.
Nighttime. At the research base, SOMEONE and the young recruit sit in a rec room with a large window overlooking a courtyard.
She morphs into the shaggy-haired boy.
She transforms back.
He strides over to a fish tank.
As he sticks his head under water, gills appear on either side.
He opens his mouth and breathe
He grins at the others, then lifts his head out.
The shaggy-haired boy stares thoughtfully.
With puzzled looks, the others press their hands to their ear
SOMEONE smiles, then releases a gust of sound.
It hits the window and shatters it.
SOMEONE turns to the black-haired exotic dancer.
She shows her wing.
She spits a ball of fire, which soars out through the shattered window, and ignites the head of a statue in the courtyard.
She gives SOMEONE a nod.
He looks away.
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a smile.
SOMEONE rises from his chair.
SOMEONE climbs out the broken window and enters the courtyard.
The others peer through the window at him.
They retreat behind the wall, then lean their bodies to look out the window again.
They remain in position.
Clenching his fists, he swivels his hips and shoulders.
Red rings of energy swirl around him and shoot off like discs.
One cuts the statue in half, leaving flames along the sever line.
Now in a meeting with SOMEONE.
Later at the research base.
through the window into the rec room, they see SOMEONE dancing on a couch.
Angel hovers in the air beside SOMEONE, who hangs upside-down from the ceiling.
SOMEONE wears scaly armor as SOMEONE slams him with a piece of metal.
With her hands on her hips, SOMEONE gapes at the rowdy youngster
SOMEONE and Angel stop dancing. SOMEONE flips down and SOMEONE's armor melts away.
She points at SOMEONE.
She grins at SOMEONE.
He gives the recruits a dry look. As he and SOMEONE leave, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE stares dejectedly as he heads off.
Now our view drifts away from a mansion on a vast countryside estate.
Words appear: "Russian Military Retreat."
As a truck trundles down a road into a thick barrier of trees bordering the estate,
SOMEONE and SOMEONE ride in back.
Lifting a hatch, they peer into the cab, where SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE.
Craning his neck, SOMEONE looks down at the road and sees soldiers guarding a roadblock up ahead.
He faces soldiers in back with him.
They arrive at the roadblock and a soldier approaches.
A dog pulls a soldier toward the truck.
As SOMEONE heads to the back, the soldiers inside raise their gun
SOMEONE touches his temple.
The dog sniffs around the vehicle and SOMEONE leads a soldier to the truck's rear.
Throwing open its doors, he finds it empty. Standing among the soldiers with drawn weapons, SOMEONE keeps his fingers on his temple.
SOMEONE turns to the soldier
As he swings the doors closed, SOMEONE lowers his hand.
His shoulders sag in relief and SOMEONE pats his knee.
Later a view through binoculars shows a helicopter landing at the military retreat.
Hidden behind a hill, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch as SOMEONE climbs off the chopper and heads toward the mansion.
With puzzled looks, they lower their binocular
As he touches his temple, SOMEONE and SOMEONE raise their binoculars again.
SOMEONE's mind's eye zooms past a barbed-wire fence protecting the mansion
to a soldier standing guard at its portico.
The Russian man blinks as if dazed, then shifts his gaze to SOMEONE as she greets a mustached general.
The general escorts her inside and SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE.
The telepath frowns.
The violated Russian soldier gives a puzzled look.
He runs off.
Meanwhile in a bedroom, the general toasts with SOMEONE.
He drains his drink and SOMEONE sips her
They set down their glasses.
With a seductive look, she rises from a couch.
She undoes the belt on her dress.
She lowers her zipper, which trails from her collar to the hem of her skirt.
The general stares with hungry eyes.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch through binoculars as coils of the barbed-wire fence wrap around soldiers guarding it
and pull them to the ground.
SOMEONE directs a gate to lift and sprints underneath. As the guards by the portico aim their weapons,
SOMEONE extends his arms, drawing the soldiers toward him, then pulls his elbows down, causing them to fall.
He kicks one as he races past.
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE.
Now SOMEONE enters the mansion.
As two soldiers aim their weapons, he commands the guns to disassemble, then hurls them into the ground.
Outside, SOMEONE spots a soldier wrapped in barbed wire.
He hurries over.
He touches the soldier's cheek. Forget my face.
The Russian's eyes close and his head drops.
SOMEONE rushes to the mansion.
In the bedroom, the general sits on the bed, with SOMEONE straddling him.
The real SOMEONE watches from the couch.
Dressed in only her underwear, she nibbles a cracker.
Bursting into the room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE find the mustached general fondling his imaginary woman.
They exchange a look and SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
Coming out of his trance, the general glare.
As he reaches for his gun, SOMEONE points at him.
The general falls back and passes out.
Standing, SOMEONE morphs into her diamond form.
With his eyes fixed on her, SOMEONE touches his temple.
SOMEONE winces.
He glances at SOMEONE.
As SOMEONE sprints to the door, the men each grab an arm and wrestle her to the brass bed frame,
where they hold her against the foot board.
SOMEONE commands its bars to wrap around her wrists.
He bends the frame to hold her tighter.
His chest heaves. As SOMEONE struggles against her restraints, he directs a bar to wrap around her neck.
He commands two more and they each bind an arm just below the shoulder.
SOMEONE's brow creases in a pained look.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
Sucking in ragged breaths, he controls the bar around SOMEONE's neck,
making it squeeze even tighter.
SOMEONE's chest heaves.
The metal wrings SOMEONE's diamond skin, causing a crack around her neck.
As SOMEONE releases the bar strangling her, the captive morphs back into her human form.
He turns away.
He prepares himself a cracker.
Gazing intently at SOMEONE, SOMEONE touches his temple.
In her mind, he sees the United States on a world map.
The focus shifts as SOMEONE places a magnet of a missile on top of Cuba.
Warheads soar around a globe, launching from the United States and landing in Russia.
As they detonate, missiles fly from Russia to the US and explode.
A burst of fire gives way to a mushroom cloud.
Another vision shows the Capitol building now in ruins amid a destroyed cityscape.
SOMEONE lowers his hand, then turns to SOMEONE.
He shifts his gaze back to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE gives a troubled look.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE watches a score display as SOMEONE plays pinball in the rec room.
In the courtyard, two agents pass the window and look in at Angel, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE.
He mimes flying.
SOMEONE stands.
With a sarcastic salute, SOMEONE draws curtains over the window, then sits again.
SOMEONE lowers her thoughtful gaze.
She returns her eyes to Angel, who looks away.
The recruits glance around.
SOMEONE turns from the pinball machine.
As he strides to the window, SOMEONE follows.
The others rise from their seats.
SOMEONE opens the curtains. Meanwhile in the man in black's office,
As the man in black steps toward his window, SOMEONE materializes behind him,
grabs the subordinate agent, then disappears with him.
Reappearing, he grabs the supervising agent and teleports him into the sky above the base.
The recruits watch through the window as SOMEONE releases the man in black, then disappear
The portly agent plummets to the courtyard.
Now more CIA agents rain from the sky.
One crashes through a skylight in the rec room.
As SOMEONE enters the building wearing the helmet, an agent talks into a radio.
SOMEONE absorbs his bullets.
SOMEONE lifts him by the throat. Meanwhile,
the recruits watch through the window as SOMEONE appears in the courtyard.
The agents open fire, but SOMEONE disappears.
The mutant materializes next to an agent and forces him to fire into the room.
The young mutants see a cyclone pass by the transmitter. In the main atrium, the agent dangles in SOMEONE's grasp.
A team of soldiers surrounding him cock their weapons. SOMEONE launches his captive into the air and the team fires.
As he absorbs the bullets,
SOMEONE's arms appear to split at the elbow, replicate into three forearms, then rejoin.
A soldier fires a rocket launcher. Flames engulf the SOMEONE, then shrink into his hands as he absorbs the energy.
Meanwhile, the recruits watches SOMEONE slay agents in the courtyard.
SOMEONE spears a man in the chest with his devil's tail.
As the recruits race down a hall, soldiers stop them.
In the atrium, SOMEONE stomps his foot and a glowing pulse of energy cracks the floor underneath.
It spreads to the wall, then surges around the room
taking out the balcony and the soldiers along with it.
In the hallway, the recruits and soldiers duck.
Standing at the atrium's center, SOMEONE directs the roiling flames with his gaze
and the recruits retreat down the hall.
Racing into a small lunch room, they see the cyclone through a window.
The swirling wind engulfs the transmitter, ripping it apart.
The recruits turn to the other window and find SOMEONE slaying soldiers and agents. Strangling a man with his tail, he uses him as a shield against an agent with a gun.
The agent accidentally shoots SOMEONE's hostage and the teleporter vanishes.
The cyclone outside hurls a man into the window and shatters it.
At the other window, SOMEONE appears in front of a trembling agent.
The mutant easily dispatches him, stabbing him in the back.
The cyclone-maker climbs through the broken window.
The recruits turn to see SOMEONE coming in from the other side.
The door open
SOMEONE steps in and faces the huddle of terrified young recruit
He removes the anti-telepathy helmet.
Outside, a soldier aims.
The devilish mutant materializes in the courtyard and kills him with a sword.
He faces SOMEONE pointedly.
SOMEONE looks away.
SOMEONE's gaze falls on Angel and grows seductively tender.
With a vulnerable pout, the young woman swallows and looks down at his extended hand.
She accepts it and SOMEONE leads her to the shattered window.
SOMEONE reaches out to her, but she turns away and continues out with SOMEONE.
The young man lowers his arm as she steps through the window with SOMEONE and the cyclone-maker.
SOMEONE lowers his woeful gaze.
He sighs heavily and his expression grows resolute.
He faces SOMEONE who scowls as SOMEONE speaks. The young men trade angry shove
As he comes outside, Angel smirks. SOMEONE smiles and meets him.
Behind him, the other young mutants form a line.
SOMEONE sweeps an arm behind him in a welcoming gesture.
SOMEONE joins Angel at her side and faces the other
He shields her with his body and turns to stone.
SOMEONE hurls an energy ring, but SOMEONE catches it.
He absorbs it.
SOMEONE swings at him.
SOMEONE blocks his punch, then grabs him by the jaw, forcing his mouth open.
He forces a compact mass of the energy between SOMEONE's lips, then releases him.
Angel stares sadly at her friend as SOMEONE and his team join hands, then disappear with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE convulses, his form turning metallic.
It takes on the appearance of volcanic rock
with lava beneath the surface.
SOMEONE steadies himself and becomes stone,
appearing to subdue the combustion of his body.
He faces SOMEONE, whose eyes widen.
SOMEONE reaches out to him, resuming his flesh-and-blood form.
Brilliant light shines out through cracks in his skin.
It consumes him, then overwhelms our view.
In Moscow, the Russian general looks out at a military parade through from a balcony. He goes inside.
He shakes SOMEONE's hand.
Once again, my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA.
These Americans are ruthless.
Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey.
He arrives at a world map highlighting the United States and Soviet Union, then points out the strategic location.
He plants a missile-shaped crimson marker over a sizable island southeast of the Floridian coast.
He steps in close to SOMEONE and removes the marker.
The general stares at him.
He marches to a phone on one of the long tables and picks it up.
SOMEONE, Angel, and the cyclone-maker appear before him.
He fearfully lowers the phone, then looks back at SOMEONE.
The evil mutant leader smiles and holds out his hands.
The general faces SOMEONE's menacing team.
Now a black car arrives outside the devastated research facility.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE rush out.
They find the remaining teens on a bench.
As SOMEONE embraces his adopted sister, SOMEONE joins the group.
SOMEONE hangs his head and SOMEONE looks away.
All eyes turn on SOMEONE.
SOMEONE takes him aside.
SOMEONE faces the group, his angular features set in a grim frown.
SOMEONE yields a faint comforting smile.
Now SOMEONE sits in a small room.
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from an observation room,
SOMEONE stands and strides confidently to the window.
Her finger crystallizes and she uses it to cut a circle in the glass.
The mutant lightly taps it and it drops out of the window.
Now a massive Russian ship, named Aral Sea, slowly moves across the ocean.
The captain and a few crew members stand vigilantly on the control bridge.
Captain, no sign of any American ships.
Maintain course. Full ahead.
At the Pentagon.
Around the ring-shaped table, officials raise their hands unanimously.
Now on the Xavier estate's verdant grounds.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the teens stare up at the palatial manor house.
SOMEONE gratefully kisses SOMEONE's blonde head.
She leads the group off a gravel driveway and around the side of the mansion.
Now words appear beneath a gray, overcast public square.
Moscow, Russia. In the Soviet war room.
Dear comrades, the United States have dispatched warships for Cuba.
This leaves us no choice.
The general circles the packed room, indicating the map with a long pointer.
He halts before a central table.
Comrade First Secretary, we must send in our fleet.
A bald man whispers with two colleagues on either side of him, then gives a nod.
Dispatch the fleet.
The scene freezes in a photo.
Panels featuring newsreels and headlines fill the screen.
Blossoming mushroom clouds fill the panels, which vanish.
The remaining two converge to reveal SOMEONE aiming a gun on his estate.
His hand shakes as he cocks it.
SOMEONE stands before him, the gun pointed at his head.
SOMEONE takes a deep breath as his companion grins eagerly.
He takes the gun.
Now in a long arched chamber,
SOMEONE sets up a mannequin.
Now outside, SOMEONE shatters panes of glass.
Now SOMEONE runs laps with SOMEONE.
In the bunker.
SOMEONE steps out and closes a heavy-duty hatch.
He presses an ear to the door.
Opening it, he finds the bunker's arch-shaped support beams in flames.
He grabs an extinguisher and hurriedly puts out the fire.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE fit SOMEONE with cloth-wing attachments.
At a window.
Sitting on the window's ledge, SOMEONE crosses himself, then spreads his wings.
He pitches off the window.
He plummets.
Now SOMEONE stands with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE stretches his bare feet.
They race down the driveway.
SOMEONE pulls in front, then disappears ahead of SOMEONE, who pumps his arms as he sprints.
In a blur of motion, SOMEONE appears behind SOMEONE, then catches up and taps his shoulder.
Stopping, SOMEONE shakes his head.
SOMEONE saunters over.
He slaps his back.
SOMEONE trudges away.
Passing a window, he sees SOMEONE inside.
She waves and he gives her a half-hearted smile as he returns the gesture.
Now as SOMEONE does bench presses, the barbell lifts out of her hands.
He releases the barbell.
SOMEONE morphs into her true form as she catches it.
SOMEONE stares after him as he strides away.
Now SOMEONE wears a vest with a circular panel on its chest.
Facing three mannequins, SOMEONE shoots a shaft of energy from his chest.
He destroys the one on the left.
He tries again and the blast knocks him over.
Only the middle mannequin remains standing. Later SOMEONE joins SOMEONE in a lab.
Sitting on his lap, SOMEONE peers into his microscope.
Now on top of a giant satellite dish.
SOMEONE closes his mouth.
SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE off the dish.
The shaggy-haired boy plummets toward some trees.
Rings of sound waves shoot out of his mouth, expanding in a cone shape.
They propel SOMEONE high into the air.
The boy dives back toward the satellite dish, then uses his sound rings to glide over dish's concave face.
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a disapproving look.
SOMEONE marks a mannequin with an X.
SOMEONE stands by the dummy.
On the mannequin's other side, SOMEONE inches away from the target.
SOMEONE shoots energy from his chest and the beam hits the dummy in a burst of flames.
Unharmed, SOMEONE and SOMEONE move aside. SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE's grin fades.
Now SOMEONE points at the satellite dish in the far distance.
SOMEONE stare
He shoots an uncertain look and his friend nod
SOMEONE's shoulders heave.
With his fingers spread wide, he aims his palms at the dish.
It remains motionless.
SOMEONE's hands tremble and his face flushes.
Lowering his arms, he drops his head.
Raising his fingers, he wiggles them questioningly.
SOMEONE shakes his head and SOMEONE touches his temple.
His eyes close briefly, then meet SOMEONE's.
The landscape around the brooding man blur
In his mind's eye, SOMEONE sees a young SOMEONE lighting candle
His mother stands with him and they share a smile.
Reaching out, she brushes his cheek with her finger.
As the memory fades, SOMEONE blinks out a tear.
He stares off, his chest heaving, then clenches his
SOMEONE opens his eyes and brushes a tear from his own cheek.
He hold SOMEONE's gaze.
He pats him on the shoulder.
SOMEONE faces the satellite dish.
He bows his head for a moment, then extends his hand and fingers as if stretching to reach the dish.
The dish shifts and SOMEONE knits his brow in concentration.
His hand trembles.
SOMEONE's shoulders heave as he controls the satellite dish, his face pulled into an expression of both sadness and triumph.
He curls his fingers as if holding an invisible tennis ball,
then turns his hand,
rotating the dish toward the mansion.
Breaking into a grin, he lowers his arm.
SOMEONE sticks her head out a window.
Now the group watches a TV.
Now as the Russian cargo ship glides over the ocean, SOMEONE's sub follows underwater.
SOMEONE watches the news.
Beside him, Angel twitches a smile, then clinks her glass with SOMEONE's. 
Meanwhile in SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE enter.
SOMEONE beams at him.
He holds out a case.
Grinning, SOMEONE opens it and finds two syringes with needles inside.
Her smile fades and she sits.
SOMEONE sits across from her.
SOMEONE stares with a conflicted gaze.
She leans toward him.
With a determined smile, he takes one of the shots from the case.
He taps the syringe's barrel, then prepares to inject.
He gives her a puzzled look.
SOMEONE's face falls and he glances away.
She stares into his eye
Her eyes turn yellow.
Her skin becomes blue and her hair morphs into its original color.
SOMEONE gazes at her.
Changing back into the blonde teen, SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a heartbroken look.
He nods.
She averts her outraged gaze.
Holding up the shot, he gives a firm nod, then stands and heads out of the room.
SOMEONE's betrayed eyes narrow as she watches him leave.
Lowering her gaze to the case, she removes its remaining injection, and stares at the lime-green serum in the syringe's barrel.
Now in a study, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit across from each other,
their eyes fixed on a chess game between them.
SOMEONE rests his hand on his fist while SOMEONE sips a martini.
SOMEONE sits back.
SOMEONE lifts his gaze to his and frown
SOMEONE captures one of his friend's chess pieces
Leaning his elbows on his knees, SOMEONE folds his hand
SOMEONE stares at the floor.
He looks at SOMEONE.
He holds the vengeful man's gaze.
SOMEONE gives a cool look.
Now sitting in the lab, SOMEONE taps a syringe,
then holds his thumb over its plunger.
He glances over his shoulder, then looks at the finger-like toes of his right foot.
Steeling himself, the bespectacled young man takes a breath.
Bending down, he injects himself near the ankle and presses down on the plunger.
He removes the syringe and sits up, keeping his eyes fixed on his foot.
The mutated appendage shrinks,
forming the shape of an average human foot.
SOMEONE wiggles his normal-looking toes.
Studying his new foot, the young man smiles, teary-eyed.
He glances aside, then looks at his right foot again.
The knuckles expand and the toes elongate.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
As the foot grows long and wide, things protrude from under the skin, which turns blue.
Clutching his leg, SOMEONE grits his teeth.
Things protrude on his mutating hands as well.
As he clutches at his pant leg, it rises, revealing a thick coat of blue hair.
His hand balloons in size and lands on a lamp table.
Growing blue and furry, the giant arm topples the table.
Reflected in a glass sphere, SOMEONE's human face morphs into that of a monster.
Now SOMEONE steps through a door and stops with a slight smile.
He shuts the door behind him.
SOMEONE lies in his bed.
He crosses the room. SOMEONE turns on her side and shape-shifts.
SOMEONE faces a sultry woman, slightly older, with wavy blonde hair.
She returns to her regular human form.
Starting at her hand, she shifts into her natural form, with scaly blue skin, slick dark-red hair, and pale-yellow eye
SOMEONE sits beside her on the bed.
He leans in and kisses her on the lips, then gently raises his hand to her neck.
Now SOMEONE's blue feet step onto a shag carpet.
Our view rises up the side of her naked body, revealing the hard rippled blue skin on her thigh, her forearm, and the side of her breast.
She faces SOMEONE, who takes a bottle out of a refrigerator. He faces her, slack-jawed.
She sits at a table.
She leaves the table.
SOMEONE watches her go, then lowers his gaze.
A note on one of the mansion's inner doors reads,
"Gone to the airbase. Bring the crate marked 'X'."
SOMEONE pulls it down and enters the lab.
SOMEONE and the other mutants follow him inside.
SOMEONE steps past toppled workstations.
SOMEONE glances back. SOMEONE looks on, wearing clothes but in her natural form. SOMEONE opens a crate marked "X." The whole team peers inside.
SOMEONE shuts the lid, darkening our view.
Now a hangar stands across an airfield.
Inside, our view drifts down past the nose of a massive jet
and finds the five mutants staring up at the shuttle.
Each wearing form-fitting blue-and-yellow jumpsuits, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and Mystique stand side by side.
They share concerned looks.
A broad-shouldered figure with thick forearms approaches.
As he nears the group, SOMEONE lowers his gaze and SOMEONE and SOMEONE trade a look.
The bespectacled mutant steps out of the shadows to reveal his pale-blue face framed by a coat of blue fur.
She touches his cheek.
He nods.
SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE's throat and snarls.
SOMEONE drops SOMEONE to the floor.
Now as the Aral Sea leaves a wide wake, a word appears:
On either side of the cargo ship, the opposing fleets face each other.
The crafts become blips on a US battleship's radar screen.
An admiral peers through binoculars.
The admiral grimly lowers his binocular
The officers take off their hats and put on helmets and life vests.
Meanwhile on a Russian battleship, the captain lowers a pair of binoculars, then crosses to a radioman, who shakes his head.
An officer faces him.
The captain looks over the bridge
Battle stations.
On the US-naval bridge, two triple-barreled cannons take aim.
Fleet reports all weapons ready.
The radioman speaks up. From the Kremlin sir, new orders.
As of 10:25 hours, the cargo vessel Aral Sea is hereby ordered to reverse course and return to port in Odessa.
Aral Sea, come in.
The captain watches the cargo ship.
They are not responding. She's not turning around. Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around. Do not cross the line. On the US bridge.
the admiral peers through his binoculars. Above, the mutants' sleek jet arrives. It soars low over the American fleet.
The admiral and his men watch the unique aircraft pass by.
In the cockpit, Beast eyes the ships.
The others ride in the cabin.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze. SOMEONE touches his finger to his temple and closes his eye
He envisions the cargo ship.
Inside, a crew member lies on the floor.
SOMEONE kicks him. In the jet.
The jet soars over the opposing fleets.
SOMEONE touches his temple and closes his eyes.
On the Russian ship, an officer suddenly lifts his head.
With wide eyes, he crosses the bridge, pushes a fellow officer out of his way, and presses a button.
A rocket launches from the ship.
The admiral looks on from the USS Independence.
Beast notices the rocket heading their way.
The jet barrel rolls for it to pass over.
The cabin turns upside-down, startling the mutants on board.
In the cockpit, Beast bares his fangs. The passengers brace themselves. As the rocket heads for the cargo ship, SOMEONE notices and disappear
The ship erupts in a fiery blaze. On the submarine.
On the jet.

SOMEONE presses a button on a nearby control panel.
The two sisters pull the ride's safety harnesses over their shoulders
then blast away several charging zombies.
The seats launch up the tower then gently drift back down.
They stop halfway and launch again.
A crowd of zombies circles the tower base, six bodies deep.
They uselessly grab at the air.
As the ride pauses at the top of the tower, SOMEONE and Little SOMEONE's feet dangle over the growing crowd of zombies below.
